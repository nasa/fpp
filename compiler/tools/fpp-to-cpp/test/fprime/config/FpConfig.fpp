# Interger type aliases:
# Used for the project to override types supplied by the platform for things like sizes, indicies, etc.

@ The unsigned type of larger sizes internal to the software,
@ e.g., memory buffer sizes, file sizes. Must be unsigned.
type FwSizeType = PlatformSizeType

@ The signed type of larger sizes internal to the software, used
@ for signed offsets, e.g., file seek offsets. Must be signed.
type FwSignedSizeType = PlatformSignedSizeType

@ The type of smaller indicies internal to the software, used
@ for array indicies, e.g., port indicies. Must be signed.
type FwIndexType = PlatformIndexType

@ The type of arguments to assert functions.
type FwAssertArgType = PlatformAssertArgType

@ The type of task priorities used.
type FwTaskPriorityType = PlatformTaskPriorityType;

@ The type of queue priorities used.
type FwQueuePriorityType = PlatformQueuePriorityType
