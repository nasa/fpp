# Integer type aliases:
# Used for the project to override types supplied by the platform for things like sizes, indices, etc.

@ The unsigned type of larger sizes internal to the software,
@ e.g., memory buffer sizes, file sizes. Must be unsigned.

@ The signed type of larger sizes internal to the software, used
@ for signed offsets, e.g., file seek offsets. Must be signed.
type FwSignedSizeType = PlatformSignedSizeType

@ The type of smaller indices internal to the software, used
@ for array indices, e.g., port indices. Must be signed.
type FwIndexType = PlatformIndexType

@ The type of arguments to assert functions.
type FwAssertArgType = PlatformAssertArgType

@ The type of task priorities used.
type FwTaskPriorityType = PlatformTaskPriorityType

@ The type of queue priorities used.

@ The id type.

@ The type of task priorities used.

# GDS type aliases:
# Used for the project to override types shared with GDSes and other remote systems.
