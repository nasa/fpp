== Lexical Elements

Before parsing an FPP model, the compiler converts the source
text into a list of **tokens**.
This process is called **lexing**.

A token is one of the following:

* A <<Lexical-Elements_Reserved-Words,reserved word>>.

* A <<Lexical-Elements_Symbols,symbol>>.

* An <<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,identifier>>.

* An <<Expressions_Integer-Literals,integer literal>>.

* A <<Expressions_Floating-Point-Literals,floating-point literal>>.

* A <<Expressions_String-Literals,string literal>>.

* An <<Lexical-Elements_End-of-Line-Tokens,end-of-line token>>.

* A line of an <<Comments-and-Annotations_Annotations,annotation>>
beginning with `@` or `@<`.

=== Reserved Words

The following are reserved words in FPP.
They may not be used as identifiers, except
when preceded by the `$` character, as discussed below.

=== Symbols

The following sequences of characters are symbol tokens in FPP:

[source,fpp]
----
(
)
*
+
,
-
->
.
/
:
;
=
[
]
{
}
----

=== Identifiers

*Definition:* An *identifier* is an unqualified name
consisting of one or more characters. The first character
must be a letter or an underscore. Characters after the first character
may be letters, digits, and underscores.

For example:

* `identifier`, `identifier3`, and `__identifier3` are valid identifiers.

* `3identifier` is not a valid identifier, because it starts with a digit.

* `identifier%` is not a valid identifier, because it contains the character `%`.

*Escaped keywords:* Any identifier may be preceded by the character `$`, with
no intervening space.
An identifier `$` _I_ has the same meaning as _I_, except that if _I_ is a
<<Lexical-Elements_Reserved-Words,reserved word>>, then _I_ is scanned
as an identifier and not as a reserved word.

For example:

* `$identifier` is a valid identifier.  It has the same meaning as `identifier`.

* `$time` is a valid identifier. It represents the character sequence `time`
treated as an identifier and not as a reserved word.

* `time` is a reserved word. It may not be used as an identifier.

=== End-of-Line Tokens

An *end-of-line token* is a sequence of one or more *newlines*.
A newline (or line break) is the NL character (ASCII code 0x0A),
optionally preceded by a CR
character (ASCII code 0x0D). End-of-line tokens separate the elements of
<<Element-Sequences,element sequences>>.

=== Comments

The lexer ignores <<Comments-and-Annotations_Comments,comments>>.
Specifically:

* A comment followed by a <<Lexical-Elements_End-of-Line-Tokens,newline>> is treated as
a newline.

* A comment at the end of a file, not followed by a newline, is
treated as no text.

=== Whitespace and Non-Printable Characters

Apart from <<Lexical-Elements_End-of-Line-Tokens,end-of-line tokens>>, the
lexer treats whitespace as follows:

* Space characters are ignored, except to separate tokens.

* No other whitespace or non-printable characters are allowed
outside of a string, comment, or annotation.
In particular, the tab character may not appear
in an FPP model outside of a string, comment, or annotation.

=== Explicit Line Continuations

The character `\`, when appearing before a
<<Lexical-Elements_End-of-Line-Tokens,newline>>,
suppresses the newline.
Both the `\` and the following newline are ignored, and no
<<Lexical-Elements_End-of-Line-Tokens,end-of-line token>>,
is created.
For example, this

[source,fpp]
----
constant a \
  = 1
----
is equivalent to this:

[source,fpp]
----
constant a = 1
----

Note that `\` is required in this case.
For example, the following is not syntactically correct:

[source,fpp]
----
constant a # Error
  = 1
----

The newline indicates the end of an element sequence, but
`constant a` is not a valid element sequence.

=== Automatic Suppression of Newlines

The following symbols consume sequences of newlines that
follow them, without creating an
<<Lexical-Elements_End-of-Line-Tokens,end-of-line token>>:

[source,fpp]
----
(
*
+
,
-
->
/
:
;
=
[
{
----

For example, the following code is legal:

[source,fpp]
----
module M {
  constant a = 0
}
----

It is equivalent to this code:

[source,fpp]
----
module M { constant a = 0 }
----

The newline after the `{` symbol is consumed by the symbol.
The newline after the constant definition is consumed
by the element sequence member.

The following code is also legal, because the newline is
consumed by the `=` symbol:

[source,fpp]
----
constant a =
  0
----

Similarly, the following code is legal, because the newline
is consumed by the `+` symbol:

[source,fpp]
----
constant a = 1 +
  2
----

=== Collapsing of Newlines

To simplify parsing, the lexer may collapse a sequence of one or more
<<Lexical-Elements_End-of-Line-Tokens,end-of-line tokens>>
into a single token, or into no token, if
the operation does not change the meaning of the result according
to the parse rules.
For example, the lexer may treat this code

[source,fpp]
----
constant a = [
  1
  2
  3

]
----

as if it were this

[source,fpp]
----
constant a = [
  1
  2
  3
]
----

or this

[source,fpp]
----
constant a = [
  1
  2
  3 ]
----

According to the rules for
<<Element-Sequences,parsing element sequences>>,
all three code sections are equivalent.
