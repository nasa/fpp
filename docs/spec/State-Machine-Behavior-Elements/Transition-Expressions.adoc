=== Transition Expressions

An *transition expression* specifies a transition as part of an
<<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_Initial-Transition-Specifiers,initial transition>>,
a <<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_State-Transition-Specifiers,state transition>>,
or
a <<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_Junction-Definitions,junction>>.
The transition performs zero or more actions and then
enters a state or junction.

==== Syntax

_[_
<<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_Do-Expressions,_do-expression_>>
_]_
`enter` <<Scoping-of-Names_Qualified-Identifiers,_qual-ident_>>


==== Semantics

. The do expression specifies the list of actions to be
performed when making the transition.
If there are no actions, the do expression may be omitted.

. The qualified identifier after the keyword `enter` must
<<Definitions_State-Machine-Definitions_Semantics_Scoping-of-Names,refer>>
to a 
<<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_State-Definitions,state definition>>
or a
<<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_Junction-Definitions,junction definition>>
It is the state or junction that is entered in the transition.
