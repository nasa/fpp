=== Alias Type Definitions

An *alias type definition* associates a name with a type
that is defined elsewhere.

==== Syntax

_[_
`dictionary`
_]_
`type` <<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>> = <<Type-Names,_type-name_>>

==== Semantics

The identifier is the name _N_ of the type.
The definition associates the name _N_ with
the type _T_ specified after the `=` symbol.
Elsewhere in the model, the name _N_ may be used as alias of (i.e., an
alternate name for) the type _T_.

If the optional `dictionary` keyword is present, then the
definition must conform to the rules stated in the 
<<Definitions_Dictionary-Definitions,dictionary definitions>> section.

==== Examples

----
# Defines a type A that is an alias of U32
type A = U32

# Defines a struct type B whose member x has type A
struct B {
  x: A
  y: F32
} default { y = 1 }
