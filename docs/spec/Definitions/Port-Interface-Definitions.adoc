=== Port Interface Definitions

A *port interface definition* defines an F Prime port interface.
A port interface is a collection of
<<Specifiers_Port-Instance-Specifiers,port instance specifiers>>
that may be imported into a
<<Definitions_Component-Definitions,component definition>>
or another port interface definition. Interfaces may also be
used in <<Definitions_Topology-Template-Definitions,topology template
definitions>> as parameters to <<Interface-Binding,bind>> to
concrete toplogies and component instances.

==== Syntax

`interface` <<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>
`{` _port-interface-member-sequence_ `}`

_port-interface-member-sequence_ is an
<<Element-Sequences,element sequence>> in
which each element is a *port interface member*,
and the terminating punctuation is a semicolon.
A port interface member is one of the following:

* A <<Specifiers_Port-Instance-Specifiers,port instance specifier>>

* An <<Specifiers_Interface-Import-Specifiers,interface import specifier>>

==== Semantics

The identifier is the name of the interface.

A port interface definition _D_ represents a set _S_ of port instance
specifiers, computed as follows:

. Add each port instance specifier that is a member of _D_ to _S_.

. For each interface import specifier _s_ that is a member of _D_,
<<Specifiers_Interface-Import-Specifiers_Semantics,resolve>> _s_ to a set of port
instance specifiers _S~s~_ and add _S~s~_ to _S_.

The set of port instance specifiers represented by _D_ must satisfy
the following rules:

. Each port instance specifier must have a distinct name.

. There must be at most one of each special port kind.

==== Examples

[source,fpp]
----
@ A command interface
interface CommandInterface {

  @ A port for receiving commands from the command dispatcher
  command recv port cmdIn

  @ A port for sending command registration requests to the command dispatcher
  command reg port cmdRegOut

  @ A port for sending responses to the command dispatcher
  command resp port cmdRespOut

}

@ A com interface
interface ComInterface {

  @ Com input port
  async input port comIn: Fw.Com

  @ Com output port
  output port comOut: Fw.Com

}

@ A component that imports the Command and Com interfaces separately
active component CommandComSeparate {

  @ Import the command interface
  import CommandInterface

  @ Import the com interface
  import ComInterface

}

@ An interface composed of the Command and Com interfaces
interface CommandComInterface {

  @ Import the command interface
  import CommandInterface

  @ Import the com interface
  import ComInterface

}

@ A component that imports the CommandCom interface
interface CommandComComposed {

  @ Import the CommandCom interface
  import CommandComInterface

}
