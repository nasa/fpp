=== Enum Definitions

An *enum definition* does two things:

.  It defines a type stem:[T] and associates a name stem:[N] with stem:[T]. Elsewhere
in the model, you can use stem:[N] to refer to stem:[T].

.  It associates several named constants stem:[C_1, ..., C_n] with stem:[T].
These
constants, called the *enumerated constants* of stem:[T], are the values that
an expression of type stem:[T] may attain. Elsewhere in the model, you can
use the <<Scoping-of-Names_Qualified-Identifiers,qualified
identifiers>> stem:[N] `.` stem:[C_1, ..., N] `.` stem:[C_n]
to refer to the enumerated
constants.

==== Syntax

_[_
`dictionary`
_]_
`enum` <<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>
_[_ `:` <<Type-Names,_type-name_>> _]_
`{` _enum-constant-sequence_ `}`
_[_
`default` <<Expressions,_expression_>>
_]_

_enum-constant-sequence_ is an
<<Element-Sequences,element sequence>> in which the elements are
<<Definitions_Enumerated-Constant-Definitions,enumerated
constant definitions>>, and the terminating punctuation is a comma.

==== Semantics

The enumerated constants have the <<Types_Enum-Types,enum type>> defined in the
enum definition. During
<<Analysis-and-Translation,analysis>>, they are represented as values of
a primitive integer type, called the
*representation type*.

There must be at least one enumerated constant.
No two enumerated constants may have the same identifier.
Each enumerated constant must <<Evaluation,evaluate>> to
a compile-time constant whose type is
<<Type-Checking_Type-Conversion,convertible to>> the
representation type.
No two enumerated constants may have the same value after the conversion.

The expression following the keyword `default` is optional.
If present, it specifies the <<Types_Default-Values,default value>> associated
with the enum definition.
The type of the expression must be the type of the enum definition.

If the optional `dictionary` keyword is present, then the
definition must conform to the rules stated in the 
<<Definitions_Dictionary-Definitions,dictionary definitions>> section.

==== Inferred Representation Type

If _type-name_ does not appear after the identifier, then
the implied representation type is `I32`.

==== Explicit Representation Type

If _type-name_ appears after the identifier, then the semantic
analyzer does the following:

. Check that _type-name_ names a <<Types_Primitive-Integer-Types,primitive
integer type>>.
If not, throw an error.

. Use stem:[T] as the representation type.

==== Examples

The following example shows two definitions. In the first one, the implied
representation type is `I32`.
In the second one, the representation type is explicitly given as `U8`.

[source,fpp]
----
enum Gunfighters {
  IL_BUONO
  IL_BRUTTO
  IL_CATTIVO
}

enum U8Gunfighters: U8 {
  IL_BUONO
  IL_BRUTTO
  IL_CATTIVO
}
----

The next example shows an enum definition with an explicit
default value.

[source,fpp]
----
enum Status {
  YES
  NO
  MAYBE
} default MAYBE
----
