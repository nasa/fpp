=== Constant Definitions

A *constant definition* associates a name with a compile-time constant
value. You can use the name in place of the value elsewhere in the
model.

==== Syntax

`constant`
<<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>
`=`
<<Expressions,_expression_>>

==== Semantics

_expression_ must
<<Evaluation,evaluate>>
to a compile-time constant value _v_. At any model point where the
<<Scoping-of-Names_Qualified-Identifiers,qualified identifier>> _Q_ refers to 
the constant definition according to the
<<Scoping-of-Names_Resolution-of-Qualified-Identifiers,scoping
rules for names>>, you can use _Q_ as a name for _v_.

==== Examples

[source,fpp]
----
constant a = 0 # a has value 0
constant b = 1.0 # b has value 1.0
constant c = a # c has value 0
