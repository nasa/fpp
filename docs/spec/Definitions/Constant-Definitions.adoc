=== Constant Definitions

A *constant definition* associates a name with a compile-time constant
value. You can use the name in place of the value elsewhere in the
model.

==== Syntax

`constant`
<<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>
`=`
<<Expressions,_expression_>>

==== Semantics

. The identifier _I_ names the constant definition.

. _expression_ must
<<Evaluation,evaluate>>
to a compile-time constant value _v_. At any model point where the
<<Scoping-of-Names_Qualified-Identifiers,qualified identifier>> _Q_ refers to
the constant definition according to the
<<Scoping-of-Names_Resolution-of-Qualified-Identifiers,scoping
rules for names>>, you can use _Q_ as a name for _v_.

. If _expression_ is a <<Expressions_Struct-Expressions,struct expression>> _S_,
each member _M_ in _S_ will be mapped to a constant definition _I_ `.` _M_ where
it's value is _S_ `.` _M_.

==== Examples

[source,fpp]
----
constant a = 0 # a has value 0
constant b = 1.0 # b has value 1.0
constant c = a # c has value 0

constant d = {
    a: 0,
    b: "str",
} # d.a has value 0, d.b has value "str"
