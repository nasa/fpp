=== Dictionary Definitions

If a type definition or a constant definition has the optional 
`dictionary` keyword, then it is called a *dictionary definition*.

==== Semantics

Type definitions that are included in the dictionary must be
<<Types_Displayable-Types, displayable>>.

Constants that are included in the dictionary must be one of
the following:

* A <<Types_Primitive-Types,primitive type>>.
* A <<Types_String-Types,string type>>.
* An <<Types_Enum-Types,enum type>>.

==== Examples

----
dictionary type T = U32
dictionary array A = [3] string
dictionary constant a = 0
