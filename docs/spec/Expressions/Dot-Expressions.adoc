=== Dot Expressions

A *dot expression* is an expression that selects a
member of a <<Types_Struct-Types,struct>> or <<Types_Internal-Types_Anonymous-Struct-Types,
anonymous struct>> typed expression or a <<Definitions-and-Uses_Uses,use>> that refers to a
<<Definitions_Constant-Definitions,constant definition>>
or
<<Definitions_Enumerated-Constant-Definitions,enumerated constant definition>>.

==== Syntax

<<Expressions,_expression_>>
`.`
<<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>

==== Semantics

The following rules give the meaning of a dot expression stem:[e]`.x`:

. If stem:[e] is an <<Expressions,expression>> of <<Types_Struct-Types,struct type>>
or <<Types_Internal-Types_Anonymous-Struct-Types,anonymous struct type>>
where `x` is a member, then it evaluates to the value stored in the member of the
corresponding <<Values_Struct-Values,struct value>>.

. If stem:[e]`.x` is a
<<Scoping-of-Names_Qualified-Identifiers,qualified
identifier>> that represents one of the uses listed above according to
the
<<Scoping-of-Names_Resolution-of-Qualified-Identifiers,rules
for resolving qualified identifiers>>, then it evaluates to the value
stored in the corresponding <<Definitions,definition>>.

.  Otherwise stem:[e]`.x` is invalid.

==== Examples

===== Example 1

[source,fpp]
----
module M {
  constant a = 1
}
constant b = M.a # M.a evaluates to 1
----

===== Example 2

[source,fpp]
----
enum E { X = 0, Y = 1 }
constant a = E.X # E.X evaluates to 0
----

===== Example 3

[source,fpp]
----
module M {
  constant a = {
    b = 10.2,
    c = "string",
  }
}
constant a = M.a.b # M.a.b evaluates to 10.2
----
