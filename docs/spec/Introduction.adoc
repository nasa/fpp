== Introduction

This document provides a detailed description of **F Prime Prime**, also known
as FPP or F Double Prime.
FPP is a modeling language for the
https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov[F Prime flight software framework].

The goals of FPP are as follows:

* To provide a modeling language for F Prime that is simple, easy to use, and
well-tailored to the domain.

* To provide semantic checking and error reporting for F Prime models.

* To generate code in the various formats that F Prime uses, e.g.,
C++, Python, XML.

The purpose of this document is to describe FPP with enough precision and
detail to guide an implementation.
It is primarily aimed at language implementers, although FPP users may also
benefit from the level of precision and detail that it provides.
It is recommended that FPP users read
https://nasa.github.io/fpp/fpp-users-guide.html[_The FPP User's Guide_]
before consulting this document.
