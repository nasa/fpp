=== Telemetry Packet Group Specifiers

A *telemetry packet group specifier* groups the telemetry channels of a
topology into <<Specifiers_Telemetry-Packet-Specifiers,telemetry packets>>.
A telemetry packet group specifier is part of a
<<Definitions_Topology-Definitions, topology definition>>.

==== Syntax

`telemetry` `packets`
<<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>
`{` _telemetry-packet-group-member-sequence_ `}`
_[_
`omit`
`{` _telemetry-channel-identifier-sequence_ `}`
_]_

_telemetry-packet-group-member-sequence_ is an
<<Element-Sequences,element sequence>> in
which each element is a *telemetry packet group member*,
and the terminating punctuation is a comma.
A telemetry packet group member is one of the following:

* An <<Specifiers_Include-Specifiers,include specifier>>.

* A <<Specifiers_Telemetry-Packet-Specifiers,telemetry packet specifier>>.

_telemetry-channel-identifier-sequence_ is an
<<Element-Sequences,element sequence>> in
which each element is a
<<Component-Instance-Member-Identifiers_Telemetry-Channel-Identifiers,
telemetry channel identifier>>,
and the terminating punctuation is a comma.

==== Semantics

FPP recursively resolves any include specifiers in 
_telemetry-packet-group-member-sequence_.
This action converts _telemetry-packet-group-member-sequence_ to a
list _L_ of telemetry packet specifiers,
each of which is a list of telemetry channel identifiers.
FPP then checks the following:

. Each telemetry packet specifier in _L_ is
<<Specifiers_Telemetry-Packet-Specifiers,valid>>,

. Each telemetry packet specifier in _L_ has
a distinct name and a distinct identifier.

. For every component instance _I_ available in the enclosing topology, either through
<<Specifiers_Component-Instance-Specifiers,direct specification>>
or through
<<Specifiers_Topology-Import-Specifiers,import>>,
for every telemetry channel _T_ that is a member of _I_,
exactly one of the following is true:

.. _T_ appears in at least one of the telemetry packet specifiers of _L_.

.. _telemetry-channel-identifier-sequence_ is present, and _T_ appears in
_telemetry-channel-identifier-sequence_.
