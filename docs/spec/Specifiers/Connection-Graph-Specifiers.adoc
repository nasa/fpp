=== Connection Graph Specifiers

A *connection graph specifier* specifies one or more *connection graphs*
as part of a
<<Definitions_Topology-Definitions,topology definition>>.
A connection graph is a named set of *connections*.
A connection connects an <<Specifiers_Port-Instance-Specifiers,output port
instance>> of one
<<Specifiers_Component-Instance-Specifiers,component instance>>
to an
<<Specifiers_Port-Instance-Specifiers,input port instance>> of
another.

==== Syntax

A connection graph specifier is one of the following:

* A *direct graph specifier:*
`connections`
<<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,_identifier_>>
`{` _connection-sequence_ `}`

* A *pattern graph specifier:*
_pattern-kind_
`connections`
`instance` <<Scoping-of-Names_Qualified-Identifiers,_qual-ident_>>
_[_
`{` _instance-sequence_ `}`
_]_

_connection-sequence_ is an
<<Element-Sequences,element sequence>> in
which each element is a *connection*,
and the terminating punctuation is a comma.
A connection is the following:

_[_
`unmatched`
_]_
<<Component-Instance-Member-Identifiers_Port-Instance-Identifiers,_port-instance-id_>>
_[_
`[`
<<Expressions,_expression_>>
`]`
_]_
`pass:[->]`
<<Component-Instance-Member-Identifiers_Port-Instance-Identifiers,_port-instance-id_>>
_[_
`[`
<<Expressions,_expression_>>
`]`
_]_

_pattern-kind_ is one of the following:

. `command`

. `event`

. `health`

. `param`

. `telemetry`

. `text` `event`

. `time`

_instance-sequence_ is an
<<Element-Sequences,element sequence>> in
which each element is a
<<Scoping-of-Names_Qualified-Identifiers,qualified identifier>>,
and the terminating punctuation is a comma.

==== Semantics

*Direct graph specifiers.*
A direct graph specifier directly specifies a named connection graph.

. The identifier following the keyword `connections` names
the connection graph.

. The connection sequence specifies the set of connections in the graph.
For each connection _C_:

.. The optional keyword `unmatched` is allowed only if _C_ is
<<Definitions_Topology-Definitions_Semantics_Automatic-Numbering-of-Ports,
match constrained>>.
In this case, if the keyword `unmatched` is present, then _C_ is
unmatched.

.. For each of the two port instance identifiers _I_ appearing in _C_:

... The component instance named in _I_
must be available in the enclosing topology,
either through
<<Specifiers_Component-Instance-Specifiers,direct specification>>
or through
<<Specifiers_Topology-Import-Specifiers,import>>.

... The optional expression _e_ following the identifier, if it is present,
represents a port number, i.e., an index into an
array of port instances.
The type of _e_ must be a
<<Types_Internal-Types_Numeric-Types,numeric type>>, and
_e_ must
<<Evaluation,evaluate>> to a compile-time constant
that becomes a non-negative integer _n_ when
<<Evaluation_Type-Conversion,converted to>> type _Integer_.
_n_ must lie in the range [0,2^31^) and must be in bounds for the
array size of the port instance specifier named in _I_.

.. The arrow represents the direction of the connection (left to right).

.. The connection must go from an
<<Specifiers_Port-Instance-Specifiers,output port instance>>
to an
<<Specifiers_Port-Instance-Specifiers,input port instance>>.

.. The <<Specifiers_Port-Instance-Specifiers,port instance types>>
specified in the two port instances must match,
except that a `serial` port at either end can be connected
to any port at the other end.

.. If a `serial` port instance _S_ is connected to a typed port
instance _T_, then the <<Definitions_Port-Definitions,port type>>
specified in _T_ may not have a return type.

*Pattern graph specifiers.*
A pattern graph specifier indirectly specifies one or more named connection
graphs
by specifying a source component instance, a set of target component
instances, and a pattern for connecting the source instance to each of the
target instances.

. Each topology may contain at most one of each kind of graph pattern.

. The qualified identifier following the keyword `instance` must
<<Scoping-of-Names_Resolution-of-Qualified-Identifiers,refer to>>
a component instance that is available in the enclosing topology,
either through
<<Specifiers_Component-Instance-Specifiers,direct specification>>
or through
<<Specifiers_Topology-Import-Specifiers,import>>.

. If the instance sequence _I_ appears, then each qualified identifier
_Q_ appearing in _I_ must refer to a component instance that is available
in the enclosing topology, and each instance must be valid for the pattern
(i.e., must have a port of the type required for the pattern).
The instances in the sequence name the target instances for the
pattern. If no instance sequence appears, then the target instances are
all instances specified directly in the enclosing topology (not via import)
that are valid for the pattern.

The meaning of specifier depends on the pattern kind, as follows:

. `command`: The source instance _I_ is a command dispatcher.
The following connection graphs are generated:

.. A connection graph named `Command` consisting of all connections
from the output port of type `Fw::Cmd` of _I_ to the command input port
of each target component.

.. A connection graph named `CommandRegistration` consisting of all
connections from the command registration output port of
each target component
to the command registration input port of _I_.

.. A connection graph named `CommandResponse` consisting of all connections
from the command response output port of each target component
to the command response input port of _I_.

. `event`: The source instance _I_ is an event logger
with an input port of type `Fw.Log`.
The generated connection graph has name `Events` and contains
all connections for sending events to _I_ through an event
output port.

. `health`: The source instance _I_ is a health component.
The generated connection graph has name `Health` and contains
all connections between the health component and ping
ports of the target components of type `Svc.Ping`.

. `param`: The source instance _I_ is a parameter database
component.
The generate connection graph has name `Parameters`
and contains all connections for (a) getting
parameters from the database and (b) saving
parameters to the database.

. `telemetry`: The source instance _I_ is a telemetry database
with an input port of type `Fw.Tlm`.
The generated connection graph has name `Telemetry`
and contains all connections for sending telemetry to _I_
through a telemetry output port.

. `text event`: The source instance _I_ is a text event
logger with an input port of type `Fw.LogText`.
The generated connection graph has name `TextEvents` and contains
all connections for sending events to _I_ through an event
output port.

. `time`: The source instance _I_ is a time component.
The generated connection graph has name `Time` and contains
all connections for getting the time from _I_ through
a time get output port.

==== Example

Assume the following instances are available in the enclosing topology,
and all have command ports:

[source,fpp]
----
commandDispatcher
commandSequencer
engineeringTelemetryLogger
eventLogger
telemetryDatabase
timeSource
----

Here is a pattern graph specifier:

[source,fpp]
----
command connections instance commandDispatcher
----

It is equivalent to the following direct graph specifiers:

[source,fpp]
----
connections CommandRegistration {
  commandDispatcher.cmdRegOut -> commandDispatcher.cmdRegIn
  commandSequencer.cmdRegOut -> commandDispatcher.cmdRegIn
  engineeringTelemetryLogger.cmdRegOut -> commandDispatcher.cmdRegIn
  eventLogger.cmdRegOut -> commandDispatcher.cmdRegIn
  telemetryDatabase.cmdRegOut -> commandDispatcher.cmdRegIn
  timeSource.cmdRegOut -> commandDispatcher.cmdRegIn
}

connections Command {
  commandDispatcher.cmdOut -> commandDispatcher.cmdIn
  commandDispatcher.cmdOut -> commandSequencer.cmdIn
  commandDispatcher.cmdOut -> engineeringTelemetryLogger.cmdIn
  commandDispatcher.cmdOut -> eventLogger.cmdIn
  commandDispatcher.cmdOut -> telemetryDatabase.cmdIn
  commandDispatcher.cmdOut -> timeSource.cmdIn
}

connections CommandResponse {
  commandDispatcher.cmdRespOut -> commandDispatcher.cmdRespIn
  commandSequencer.cmdRespOut -> commandDispatcher.cmdRespIn
  engineeringTelemetryLogger.cmdRespOut -> commandDispatcher.cmdRespIn
  eventLogger.cmdRespOut -> commandDispatcher.cmdRespIn
  telemetryDatabase.cmdRespOut -> commandDispatcher.cmdRespIn
  timeSource.cmdRespOut -> commandDispatcher.cmdRespIn
}
