== Scoping of Names

=== Qualified Identifiers

A *qualified identifier* is one of the following:

1.  An
<<Lexical-Elements_Identifiers,identifier>>.

2.  _Q_ `.` _I_, where _Q_ is a qualified identifier and _I_ is an
identifier.

Examples:

[source,fpp]
----
a
a.b
a.b.c
----

=== Names of Definitions

Every
<<Definitions,definition>>
 _D_ appearing in an FPP model has a unique *qualified
name*. The qualified name is a
<<Scoping-of-Names_Qualified-Identifiers,qualified identifier>> formed as follows:

* If _D_ appears outside any
<<Definitions,definition>> with a brace-delimited body, then
the qualified name is the identifier _I_ appearing in _D_.

* Otherwise, the qualified name is _N_ `.` _I_, where _N_ is the qualified
name of the enclosing definition, and _I_ is
the identifier appearing in _D_.

For example:

[source,fpp]
----
module M { # Qualified name is M
  module N { # Qualified name is M.N
    enum Maybe { # Qualified name is M.N.Maybe
      NO # Qualified name is M.N.Maybe.NO
      YES # Qualified name is M.N.Maybe.YES
    }
  }
}
----

=== Name Groups

The qualified names of definitions and
reside in the following *name groups*:

. The *component instance name group*

. The *component name group*

. The *interface name group*

. The *port name group*

. The *state machine name group*

. The *topology name group*

. The *type name group*

. The *value name group*

Definitions reside in name groups as follows:

* Abstract type definitions reside in the type name group.

* Array type definitions reside in the type name group.

* Component definitions reside in the component name group,
the value name group, the type name group, and the
state machine name group.

* Component instance definitions reside in the component instance name group.

* Constant definitions reside in the value name group.

* Enum definitions reside in both the value name group and the type name group.

* Enumerated constant definitions reside in the value name group.

* Module definitions reside in all the name groups.

* Port definitions reside in the port name group.

* Port interface definitions reside in the interface name group.

* State machine definitions reside in the component name group,
the state machine name group, and the type name group.

* Struct type definitions reside in the type name group.

* Topology definitions reside in the topology name group.

Notice that elements with scopes reside in the name groups of items
that they may enclose.
For example, enums reside in the value name group because they
enclose constant definitions.

=== Multiple Definitions with the Same Qualified Name

==== Different Name Groups

Two definitions with the same qualified name are allowed if they are in
different name groups. For example:

[source,fpp]
----
struct s { x: U32 } # Defines s in the type name group
constant s = 0 # Defines s in the value name group
----

==== Module Definitions

Multiple syntactic module definitions with the same qualified name are
allowed. The semantic analysis combines all such definitions into a
single module definition with that qualified name. For example, this
model is legal

[source,fpp]
----
module M { constant a = 0 }
module M { constant b = 1 }
a = M.a
b = M.b
----

It is equivalent to this model:

[source,fpp]
----
module M {
  constant a = 0
  constant b = 1
}
a = M.a
b = M.b
----

Because the <<Definitions-and-Uses_Order-of-Definitions-and-Uses,order
of definitions is irrelevant>>, this is also equivalent:

[source,fpp]
----
module M { constant a = 0 }
a = M.a
b = M.b
module M { constant b = 1 }
----

==== Conflicting Definitions

Within the same name group, two definitions with the same
qualified name are not allowed, unless they are both module definitions
as described above. For example:

[source,fpp]
----
module M {
  constant a = 0
  constant a = 1 # Error: Name M.a is redefined
}
----

Two definitions with the same identifier are allowed if they have
different qualified names, for example:

[source,fpp]
----
constant a = 0
module M {
  constant a = 1 # OK, qualified name is M.a =/= a
}
----

=== Resolution of Identifiers

The following rules govern the resolution of identifiers, i.e.,
associating identifiers with definitions:

. Use the context to determine which
<<Scoping-of-Names_Name-Groups,name group>>
_S_ to use. For example, if we are expecting a type name, then use the
type name group.

. At the top level (outside the brace-delimited body of any definition), the
identifier _I_ refers to the unique definition with qualified name _I_ if it
exists in name group _S_. Otherwise an error results.

. Inside the brace-delimited body of a <<Definitions,definition>> with
qualified name _N_ appearing at the top level:

  .. The identifier _I_ refers to the definition with qualified name
_N_ `.` _I_ if it exists in name group _S_.

  .. Otherwise _I_ refers to the definition with qualified name _I_ if it
exists in name group _S_.

  .. Otherwise an error results.

. Inside the brace-delimited body of a definition with qualified name
_N_ appearing inside the body of a  definition _D_:

  ..  The identifier _I_ refers to the definition with qualified name
_N_ `.` _I_ if it exists in name group _S_.

  ..  Otherwise proceed as if _I_ were appearing inside _D_.

*Example:*

_S_ refers to the value name group.

[source,fpp]
----
# Identifier M is in scope in S and refers to the qualified name M
# Identifier a is in scope in S and refers to qualified name a

constant a = 1 # Unique definition in S with qualified name a

module M {
  # Identifier M is in scope in S and refers to the qualified name M
  # Identifier N is in scope in S and refers to the qualified name N
  # Identifier a is in scope in S and refers to qualified name a
  # Identifier b is in scope in S and refers to qualified name M.b
  constant b = 2 # Unique definition in S with qualified name M.b
}

# Identifier M is in scope in S and refers to the qualified name M
# Identifier a is in scope in S and refers to qualified name a

module M {

  # Identifier M is in scope in S and refers to the qualified name M
  # Identifier N is in scope in S and refers to the qualified name M.N
  # Identifier a is in scope and refers to qualified name a
  # Identifier b is in scope and refers to qualified name M.b

  module N {
    # Identifier M is in scope in S and refers to the qualified name M
    # Identifier N is in scope in S and refers to the qualified name M.N
    # Identifier a is in scope in S and refers to qualified name a
    # Identifier b is in scope in S and refers to qualified name M.N.b
    constant b = 3 # Unique definition in S with qualified name M.N.b
  }

}

# Identifier M is in scope in S and refers to the qualified name M
# Identifier a is in scope in S and refers to qualified name a
----

=== Resolution of Qualified Identifiers

The following rules govern the resolution of
<<Scoping-of-Names_Qualified-Identifiers,qualified identifiers>>, i.e.,
associating qualified identifiers with definitions:

. If a qualified identifier is an identifier, then resolve it as
stated in the
<<Scoping-of-Names_Resolution-of-Identifiers,previous section>>.

. Otherwise, the qualified identifier has the form _Q_ `.` _I_, where
_Q_ is a qualified identifier and _I_ is an identifier. Do the
following:

.. Recursively resolve _Q_.

.. If _Q_ refers to a <<Definitions,definition>>
with a brace-delimited body, then do the following:

... Determine the <<Scoping-of-Names_Name-Groups,name group>> _S_ of _Q_ `.`
_I_.

... Look in _D_ for a definition with identifier _I_ in name group _S_.
    If there is none, issue an error.

.. Otherwise the qualified identifier is invalid. Issue an error.

*Example:*

[source,fpp]
----
module M {
  constant a = 0
  enum E {
    b = 2
    c = b # Refers to M.E.b
    d = E.b # Refers to M.E.b
    e = M.E.b # Refers to M.E.b
  }
  constant f = a # Refers to M.a
  constant g = M.a # Refers to M.a
  constant h = E.b # Refers to M.E.b
  constant i = M.E.b # Refers to M.E.b
}
