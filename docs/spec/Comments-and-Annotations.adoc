== Comments and Annotations

=== Comments

A *comment* is model text that is ignored by the translator. It
provides information to human readers of the source model.

Comments begin with the character `#` and go to the end of the line. For
example:

[source,fpp]
----
# This is a comment
----

To write a multiline comment, precede each line with `#`:

[source,fpp]
----
# This is a multiline comment.
# It has two lines.
----

=== Annotations

An *annotation* is similar to a
<<Comments-and-Annotations_Comments,comment>>, but it is attached to a
syntactic element of a model, and it is preserved during
<<Analysis-and-Translation,analysis and translation>>.  The precise use of
annotations depends on the translator. A typical use
is to include annotations as comments in generated code.

==== Where Annotations Can Occur

Annotations can occur at the following syntax elements:

* A <<Definitions,definition>>.

* A <<Definitions_Port-Interface-Definitions,member of a port interface definition>>.

* A <<Definitions_State-Machine-Definitions_Syntax,state machine member>>.

* A <<Definitions_Struct-Definitions,member of a struct definition>>.

* A <<Formal-Parameter-Lists,formal parameter>>.

* A <<Specifiers,specifier>>.

* A <<State-Machine-Behavior-Elements_State-Definitions_Syntax,state definition member>>.

These elements are called the *annotatable elements* of an FPP model.

==== Kinds of Annotations

There are two kinds of annotations: *pre-annotations* and
*post-annotations*.

A pre-annotation starts with `@` and goes to the end of the line.
Whitespace characters after the initial `@` are ignored. A
pre-annotation must occur immediately before an
<<Comments-and-Annotations_Annotations_Where-Annotations-Can-Occur,
annotatable element>> _e_. It is attached to _e_ during translation.

A post-annotation starts with `@<` and goes to the end of the line.
Whitespace characters after the initial `@<` are ignored. A
post-annotation must occur immediately after an
<<Comments-and-Annotations_Annotations_Where-Annotations-Can-Occur,
annotatable element>> _e_. It is attached to _e_ during translation.

You may follow either kind of annotation by one or more blank
lines.
In this case the blank lines are ignored.

===== Example

[source,fpp]
----
@ This is module M
module M {
  constant a = 0 @< This is constant M.a
  constant b = 1 @< This is constant M.b
  @ This is an enum
  enum E {
    a @< This is enumerated constant M.E.a
    b @< This is enumerated constant M.E.b
  }
}
----

==== Multiline Annotations

You can write several pre-annotations in a row before an
<<Comments-and-Annotations_Annotations_Where-Annotations-Can-Occur,
annotatable element>> _e_.
In this case, all the pre-annotations are attached to the
element, in the order that they appear.

Similarly, you can write several post-annotations in a row after an
<<Comments-and-Annotations_Annotations_Where-Annotations-Can-Occur,
annotatable element>> _e_.
In this case, all the post-annotations are attached to the
element, in the order that they appear.

===== Example

[source,fpp]
----
@ This is module M
@ Its pre-annotation has two lines
module M {
  constant a = 0 @< This is constant M.a
                 @< Its post-annotation has two lines
  constant b = 1 @< This is constant M.b
                 @< Its post-annotation has two lines
  @ This is an enum
  @ Its pre-annotation has two lines
  enum E {
    a @< This is enumerated constant M.E.a
      @< Its post-annotation has two lines
    b @< This is enumerated constant M.E.b
      @< Its post-annotation has two lines
  }
}
