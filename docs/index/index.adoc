= F Prime Prime (FPP)

FPP is a modeling language for the
https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov[F Prime flight software framework].
To use FPP, you write a model in the source language; then you use the FPP 
tools to generate XML and {cpp}. Compared to writing XML by hand, FPP provides 
a cleaner and more succinct syntax, a well-defined semantics, good error 
checking and reporting, and better integration between the model and the 
generated code.
