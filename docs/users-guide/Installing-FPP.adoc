== Installing FPP

Before reading the rest of this document, you should install
the latest version of FPP.
The installation instructions are available here:

https://github.com/nasa/fpp/tree/main/compiler#compiler

Make sure that the FPP command-line tools are in your shell path.
For example, running `fpp-check` on the command line should succeed and should
prompt for standard input. You can type control-C to end
the program:

----
% fpp-check
^C
%
----

`fpp-check` is the tool for checking that an FPP model is valid.
Like most FPP tools,
`fpp-check` reads either from named files or from standard input.
If one or more files are named on the command line, `fpp-check` reads those;
otherwise it reads from standard input.
As an example, the following two operations are equivalent:

----
% fpp-check < file.fpp
% fpp-check file.fpp
----

The first operation redirects `file.fpp` into the standard input of 
`fpp-check`.
The second operation names `file.fpp` as an input file of `fpp-check`.

Most of the examples in the following sections are complete FPP models.
You can run the models through
`fpp-check` by typing or pasting them into a file or into standard input.
We recommend that you to this for at least a few of the examples,
to get a feel for how FPP works.
