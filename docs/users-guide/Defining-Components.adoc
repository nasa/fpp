== Defining Components

In F Prime, the *component* is the basic unit of FSW function.
An F Prime component is similar to a class in an object-oriented language.
An F Prime FSW application is divided into several
*component instances*, each of which instantiates a component.
The component instances communicate by sending and receiving
invocations on their
<<Defining-Ports, ports>>.

In F Prime, there are three kinds of components:
active, queued, and passive.
An active component has a thread of control
and a message queue.
A queued component has a message queue, but no thread
of control; control runs on another thread, such as
a rate group thread.
A passive component has no thread of control and no
message queue; it is like a non-threaded function library.

=== Component Definitions

An FPP *component definition* defines an F Prime component.
To write a component definition, you write the following:

* The component kind: one of `active`, `passive`,
or `queued`.
* The keyword `component`.
* The <<Defining-Constants_Names,name>> of the component.
* A sequence of *component members* enclosed in curly braces
`{` ... `}`.

As an example, here is a passive component `C` with no members:

[source,fpp]
----
@ An empty passive component
passive component C {

}
----

A component definition and each of its members is an
<<Writing-Comments-and-Annotations_Annotations,annotatable element>>.
For example, you can annotate the component as shown above.
The members of a component form an
<<Defining-Constants_Multiple-Definitions-and-Element-Sequences,
element sequence>> with a semicolon as the optional
terminating punctuation.
The following sections describe the available component members.

=== Port Instances

A *port instance* is a component member that specifies an instance of an FPP
<<Defining-Ports, port>> used by the instances of the component.
Component instances use their port instances to communicate
with other component instances.

A port instance instantiates a port.
The port definition provides information common to all uses of the port, such as
the kind of data carried on the port.
The port instance provides use-specific information, such
as the name of the instance and the direction of invocation
(input or output).

==== Basic Port Instances

The simplest port instance specifies a kind, a name, and a type.
The kind is one of the following:

* `async` `input`: Input to this component that arrives on a message queue, to
be dispatched on this component's thread (if this component is active)
or on the thread of another port invocation (if this component is queued).

* `sync` `input`: Input that invokes a handler defined in this component,
and run on the thread of the caller.

* `guarded` `input`: Similar to sync input, but the handler is
guarded by a mutual exclusion lock.

* `output`: Output transmitted by this component.

The name is the name of the port instance.
The type refers to a <<Defining-Ports,port definition>>.

As an example, here is a passive component `F32Adder` that
adds two `F32` values and produces an `F32` value.

[source,fpp]
----
@ A port for carrying an F32 value
port F32Value(value: F32)

@ A passive component for adding two F32 values
passive component F32Adder {

  @ Input 1
  sync input port f32ValueIn1: F32Value

  @ Input 2
  sync input port f32ValueIn2: F32Value

  @ Output
  output port f32ValueOut: F32Value

}
----

There are two sync input port instances and one output port
instance.
The kind appears first, followed by the keyword `port`, the port instance
name, a colon, and the type.
Each port instance is an
<<Writing-Comments-and-Annotations_Annotations,annotatable element>>,
so you can annotate the instances as shown.

As another example, here is an active version of `F32Adder`
with `async` input ports:

[source,fpp]
----
@ A port for carrying an F32 value
port F32Value(value: F32)

@ An active component for adding two F32 values
active component ActiveF32Adder {

  @ Input 1
  async input port f32ValueIn1: F32Value

  @ Input 2
  async input port f32ValueIn2: F32Value

  @ Output
  output port f32ValueOut: F32Value

}
----

In each case, the adding is done in the target language.
For example, in the {cpp} implementation, you would generate a
base class with a virtual handler function, and then override that virtual
function in a derived class that you write.
For further details about implementing F Prime components, see the
https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/latest/docs/user-manual/[F Prime User Manual].

*Note on terminology:* As explained above, there is a technical
distinction between a _port type_ (defined outside any component, and providing
the type of a port instance)
and a _port instance_ (specified inside a component and instantiating
a port type).
However, it is sometimes useful to refer to a port instance with
the shorter term "port" when there is no danger of confusion.
We will do that in this manual.
For example, we will say that the `F32Adder` component has three
ports: two async input ports of type `F32Value` and one output port
of type `F32Value`.

==== Rules for Port Instances

The port instances appearing in a component definition must
satisfy certain rules.
These rules ensure that the FPP model makes sense.

First, no passive component may have an `async` `input`
port.
This is because a passive component has no message queue,
so asynchronous input is not possible.
As an example, if we modify the input ports of our `F32Adder`
to make them `async`, we get an error.

[source,fpp]
--------
port F32Value(value: F32)

# Error: Passive component may not have async input
passive component ErroneousF32Adder {

  async input port f32ValueIn1: F32Value

  async input port f32ValueIn2: F32Value

  output port f32ValueOut: F32Value

}
--------

Try presenting this code to `fpp-check` and observe what happens.

Second, an active or queued component _must_ have asynchronous input.
That means it must have at least one async input port;
or it must have an internal port;
or it must have at least one async command; or it must have
at least one state machine instance.
Internal ports, async commands, and state machine instances
are described below.
As an example, if we modify the input ports of our `ActiveF32Adder`
to make them `sync`, we get an error, because
there is no async input.

[source,fpp]
--------
port F32Value(value: F32)

# Error: Active component must have async input
active component ErroneousActiveF32Adder {

  sync input port f32ValueIn1: F32Value

  sync input port f32ValueIn2: F32Value

  output port f32ValueOut: F32Value

}
--------

Third, a port type appearing in an `async` `input` port
may not have a return type.
This is because returning a value
makes sense only for synchronous input.
As an example, this component definition is illegal:

[source,fpp]
--------
port P -> U32

active component Error {

  # Error: port instance p: P is async input and
  # port P has a return type
  async input port p: P

}
--------

==== Arrays of Port Instances

When you specify a port instance as part of an FPP component, you
are actually specifying an _array_ of port instances.
Each instance has a *port number*, where the port numbers start at zero
and go up by one at each successive element.
(Another way to say this is that the port numbers are the array indices,
and the indices start at zero.)

If you don't specify a size for the array, as shown in
the previous sections, then the array has size one, and there is a single port
instance with port number zero.
Thus a port instance specifier with no array size acts like a singleton
element.
Alternatively, you can specify an explicit array size.
You do that by writing an <<Defining-Constants_Expressions,expression>>
enclosed in square brackets `[` ... `]` denoting the size (number of elements)
of the array.
The size expression must evaluate to a numeric value.
As with
<<Defining-Types_Array-Type-Definitions_Writing-an-Array-Type-Definition,
array type definitions>>,
the size goes before the element type.
As an example, here is another version of the `F32Adder` component, this time
using a single array of two input ports instead of two named ports.

[source,fpp]
----
@ A port for carrying an F32 value
port F32Value(value: F32)

@ A passive component for adding two F32 values
passive component F32Adder {

  @ Inputs 0 and 1
  sync input port f32ValueIn: [2] F32Value

  @ Output
  output port f32ValueOut: F32Value

}
----

==== Priority

For `async` `input` ports, you may specify a priority.
The priority specification is not allowed for other kinds of ports.
To specify a priority, you write the keyword `priority` and an
expression that evaluates to a numeric value after the port type.
As an example, here is a modified version of the `ActiveF32Adder`
with specified priorities:

[source,fpp]
----
@ A port for carrying an F32 value
port F32Value(value: F32)

@ An active component for adding two F32 values
@ Uses specified priorities
active component ActiveF32Adder {

  @ Input 1 at priority 10
  async input port f32ValueIn1: F32Value priority 10

  @ Input 2 at priority 20
  async input port f32ValueIn2: F32Value priority 20

  @ Output
  output port f32ValueOut: F32Value

}
----

If an `async` `input` port has no specified priority, then the
translator uses a default priority.
The precise meaning of the default priority and of the numeric priorities is
implementation-specific.
In general the priorities regulate the order in which elements are dispatched
from the message queue.

==== Queue Full Behavior

By default, if an invocation of an `async` `input` port causes
a message queue to overflow, then a *FSW assertion* fails.
A FSW assertion is a condition that must be true in order
for FSW execution to proceed safely.
The behavior of a FSW assertion failure is configurable in the {cpp}
implementation of the F Prime framework; typically it causes a FSW
abort and system reset.

Optionally, you can specify the behavior when a message
received on an `async` `input` port causes a queue overflow.
There are three possible behaviors:

. `assert`: Fail a FSW assertion (the default behavior).
. `block`: Block the sender until the queue is available.
. `drop`: Drop the incoming message and proceed.
. `hook`: Call a user-specified function and proceed.

To specify queue full behavior, you write one of the keywords `assert`,
`block`, `drop`, or `hook` after the port type and after the priority
(if any).
As an example, here is the `ActiveF32Adder` updated with explicit
queue full behavior.

[source,fpp]
----
@ A port for carrying an F32 value
port F32Value(value: F32)

@ An active component for adding two F32 values
@ Uses specified priorities
active component ActiveF32Adder {

  @ Input 1 at priority 10: Block on queue full
  async input port f32ValueIn1: F32Value priority 10 block

  @ Input 2: Drop on queue full
  async input port f32ValueIn2: F32Value drop
  
  @ Input 3: Call hook function on queue full
  async input port f32ValueIn3: F32Value hook

  @ Output
  output port f32ValueOut: F32Value

}
----

As for priority specifiers, queue full specifiers are allowed only
for `async` `input` ports.

==== Serial Port Instances

When writing a port instance, instead of specifying a named port type,
you may write the keyword `serial`.
Doing this specifies a *serial port instance*.
A serial port instance does not specify the type of data that it carries.
It may be connected to a port of any type.
Serial data passes through the port; the data may be converted to or from a
specific type at the other end of the connection.

As an example, here is a passive component for taking a stream
of serial data and splitting it (i.e., repeating it by copy)
onto several streams:

[source,fpp]
----
@ Split factor
constant splitFactor = 10

@ Component for splitting a serial data stream
passive component SerialSplitter {

  @ Input
  sync input port serialIn: serial

  @ Output
  output port serialOut: [splitFactor] serial

}
----

By using serial ports, you can send several unrelated types
of data over the same port connection.
This technique is useful when communicating across
a network: on each side of the network connection, a single component
can act as a hub that routs all data to and from components
on that side.
This flexibility comes at the cost that you lose the type
compile-time type checking provided by port connections with named types.
For more information about serial ports and their use, see
the https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/latest/docs/user-manual/[F Prime User Manual].

=== Special Port Instances

A *special port instance* is a port instance that has a special
behavior in F Prime.
As discussed <<Defining-Components_Port-Instances,above>>,
when writing a general port instance,
you specify a port kind, a port type, and possibly other
information such as array size and priority.
Writing a special port instance is a bit different.
In this case you specify a predefined behavior
provided by the F Prime framework.
The special port behaviors fall into six groups:
commands, events, telemetry, parameters, time,
and data products.

==== Command Ports

A *command* is an instruction to the spacecraft to perform an action.
Each component instance _C_ that specifies commands has the following
high-level behaviors:

. At FSW startup time, _C_ registers its commands with a component
instance called the *command dispatcher*.

. During FSW execution, _C_ receives commands from the command
dispatcher.
For each command received, _C_ executes the command and
sends a response back to the command dispatcher.

In FPP, the keywords for the special command behaviors are as follows:

* `command` `reg`: A port for sending command registration requests.
* `command` `recv`: A port for receiving commands.
* `command` `resp`: A port for sending command responses.

Collectively, these ports are known as *command ports*.
To specify a command port, you write one of the keyword pairs
shown above followed by the keyword `port` and the port name.

As an example, here is a passive component `CommandPorts` with each
of the command ports:

[source,fpp]
----
@ A component for illustrating command ports
passive component CommandPorts {

  @ A port for receiving commands
  command recv port cmdIn

  @ A port for sending command registration requests
  command reg port cmdRegOut

  @ A port for sending command responses
  command resp port cmdResponseOut

}
----

Any component may have at most one of each kind of command
port.
If a component receives commands (more on this below),
then all three ports are required.
The port names shown in the example above are standard but not
required; you can use any names you wish.

During translation, each command port is converted into
a typed port instance with a predefined port type, as follows:

* `command` `recv` uses the port `Fw.Cmd`
* `command` `reg` uses the port `Fw.CmdReg`
* `command` `resp` uses the port `Fw.CmdResponse`

The F Prime framework provides definitions for these ports
in the directory `Fw/Cmd`.
For checking simple examples, you can use the following
simplified definitions of these ports:

[source,fpp]
--------
module Fw {
  port Cmd
  port CmdReg
  port CmdResponse
}
--------

For example, to check the `CommandPorts` component, you can
add these lines before the component definition.
If you don't do this, or something similar, then the component
definition won't pass through `fpp-check` because of the missing ports.
(Try it and see.)

Note that the port definitions shown above are for conveniently checking
simple examples only.
They are not correct for the F Prime framework and will not work
properly with F Prime {cpp} code generation.

For further information about command registration, receipt, and
response, and implementing command handlers, see the
https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/latest/docs/user-manual/[F Prime User Manual].

==== Event Ports

An *event* is a report that something happened, for example,
that a file was successfully uplinked.
The special event behaviors, and their keywords, are as follows:

* `event`: A port for emitting events as serialized bytes.
* `text` `event`: A port for emitting events as human-readable
text (usually used for testing and debugging on the ground).

Collectively, these ports are known as *event ports*.
To specify an event port, you write one of the keyword groups
shown above followed by the keyword `port` and the port name.

As an example, here is a passive component `EventPorts` with each
of the event ports:

[source,fpp]
----
@ A component for illustrating event ports
passive component EventPorts {

  @ A port for emitting events
  event port eventOut

  @ A port for emitting text events
  text event port textEventOut

}
----

Any component may have at most one of each kind of event
port.
If a component emits events (more on this below),
then both event ports are required.

During translation, each event port is converted into
a typed port instance with a predefined port type, as follows:

* `event` uses the port `Fw.Log`
* `text` `event` uses the port `Fw.LogText`

The name `Log` refers to an event log.
The F Prime framework provides definitions for these ports
in the directory `Fw/Log`.
For checking simple examples, you can use the following
simplified definitions of these ports:

[source,fpp]
--------
module Fw {
  port Log
  port LogText
}
--------

For further information about events in F Prime, see the
https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/latest/docs/user-manual/[F Prime User Manual].

==== Telemetry Ports

*Telemetry* is data regarding the state of the system.
A *telemetry port* allows a component to emit telemetry.
To specify a telemetry port, you write the keyword `telemetry`,
the keyword `port`, and the port name.

As an example, here is a passive component `TelemetryPorts` with
a telemetry port:

[source,fpp]
----
@ A component for illustrating telemetry ports
passive component TelemetryPorts {

  @ A port for emitting telemetry
  telemetry port tlmOut

}
----

Any component may have at most one telemetry port.
If a component emits telemetry (more on this below),
then a telemetry port is required.

During translation, each telemetry port is converted into
a typed port instance with the predefined port type
`Fw.Tlm`.
The F Prime framework provides a definition for this port
in the directory `Fw/Tlm`.
For checking simple examples, you can use the following
simplified definition of this port:

[source,fpp]
--------
module Fw {
  port Tlm
}
--------

For further information about telemetry in F Prime, see the
https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/latest/docs/user-manual/[F Prime User Manual].

==== Parameter Ports

A *parameter* is a configurable constant that may be updated
from the ground.
The current parameter values are stored in an F Prime component
called the *parameter database*.

The special parameter behaviors, and their keywords, are as follows:

* `param` `get`: A port for getting the current value of a parameter
from the parameter database.
* `param` `set`: A port for setting the current value of a parameter
in the parameter database.

Collectively, these ports are known as *parameter ports*.
To specify a parameter port, you write one of the keyword groups
shown above followed by the keyword `port` and the port name.

As an example, here is a passive component `ParamPorts` with each
of the parameter ports:

[source,fpp]
----
@ A component for illustrating parameter ports
passive component ParamPorts {

  @ A port for getting parameter values
  param get port prmGetOut

  @ A port for setting parameter values
  param set port prmSetOut

}
----

Any component may have at most one of each kind of parameter
port.
If a component has parameters (more on this below),
then both parameter ports are required.

During translation, each parameter port is converted into
a typed port instance with a predefined port type, as follows:

* `param` `get` uses the port `Fw.PrmGet`
* `param` `set` uses the port `Fw.PrmSet`

The F Prime framework provides definitions for these ports
in the directory `Fw/Prm`.
For checking simple examples, you can use the following
simplified definitions of these ports:

[source,fpp]
--------
module Fw {
  port PrmGet
  port PrmSet
}
--------

For further information about parameters in F Prime, see the
https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/latest/docs/user-manual/[F Prime User Manual].

==== Time Get Ports

A *time get port* allows a component to get the system time from a
time component.
To specify a time get port, you write the keywords `time` `get`,
the keyword `port`, and the port name.

As an example, here is a passive component `TimeGetPorts` with
a time get port:

[source,fpp]
----
@ A component for illustrating time get ports
passive component TimeGetPorts {

  @ A port for getting the time
  time get port timeGetOut

}
----

Any component may have at most one time get port.
If a component emits events or telemetry (more on this below),
then a time get port is required, so that the events
and telemetry points can be time stamped.

During translation, each time get port is converted into
a typed port instance with the predefined port type
`Fw.Time`.
The F Prime framework provides a definition for this port
in the directory `Fw/Time`.
For checking simple examples, you can use the following
simplified definition of this port:

[source,fpp]
--------
module Fw {
  port Time
}
--------

For further information about time in F Prime, see the
https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/latest/docs/user-manual/[F Prime User Manual].

==== Data Product Ports

A *data product* is a collection of data that can be stored to an
onboard file system, given a priority, and downlinked in priority
order.
For example, a data product may be an image or a unit of
science data.
Data products are stored in *containers* that contain
*records*.
A record is a unit of data.
A container stores (1) a header that describes the container
and (2) a list of records.

The special data product behaviors, and their keywords, are as follows:

* `product` `get`: A port for synchronously requesting a
memory buffer to store a container.

* `product` `request`: A port for asynchronously requesting
a buffer to store a container.

* `product` `recv`: A port for receiving a response to an
asynchronous buffer request.

* `product` `send`: A port for sending a buffer that stores
a container, after the container has been filled with data.

Collectively, these ports are known as *data product ports*.
To specify a data product port, you write one of the keyword groups
shown above followed by the keyword `port` and the port name.
To specify a product receive port, you must first write
`async`, `sync` or `guarded` to specify whether the input port
is asynchronous, synchronous, or guarded, as described in
the section on <<Defining-Components_Port-Instances_Basic-Port-Instances,
basic port instances>>.
When specifying an `async` product receive port, you may
specify a <<Defining-Components_Port-Instances_Priority,priority behavior>>
or <<Defining-Components_Port-Instances_Queue-Full-Behavior,queue full behavior>>.

As an example, here is a passive component `DataProductPorts` with each
of the data product ports:

[source,fpp]
----
@ A component for illustrating data product ports
active component DataProductPorts {

  @ A port for getting a data product container
  product get port productGetOut

  @ A port for requesting a data product container
  product request port productRequestOut

  @ An async port for receiving a requested data product container
  async product recv port productRecvIn priority 10 assert

  @ A port for sending a filled data product container
  product send port productSendOut

}
----

Any component may have at most one of each kind of data product
port.
If a component defines data products (more on this below),
then there must be (1) a product get port or a product request port
and (2) a product send port.
If there is a product request port, then there must be a product
receive port.

During translation, each data product port is converted into
a typed port instance with a predefined port type, as follows:

* `product` `get` uses the port `Fw.DpGet`
* `product` `request` uses the port `Fw.DpRequest`
* `product` `recv` uses the port `Fw.DpResponse`
* `product` `send` uses the port `Fw.DpSend`

The F Prime framework provides definitions for these ports
in the directory `Fw/Dp`.
For checking simple examples, you can use the following
simplified definitions of these ports:

[source,fpp]
--------
module Fw {
  port DpGet
  port DpRequest
  port DpResponse
  port DpSend
}
--------

For further information about data products in F Prime, see the
https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/latest/docs/user-manual/design/data-products/[F 
Prime design documentation].


=== Internal Ports

An *internal port* is a port that a component can use to send a
message to itself.
In the ordinary case, when a component sends a message, it invokes an
output port that is connected to an async input port.
When the output port and input port reside in the same component,
it is simpler to use an internal port.

As an example, suppose we have a component
that needs to send a message to itself.
We could construct such a component in the following way:

[source,fpp]
----
@ A data type T
type T

@ A port for sending data of type T
port P(t: T)

@ A component that sends data to itself on an async input port
active component ExternalSelfMessage {

  @ A port for sending data of type T
  async input port pIn: P

  @ A port for receiving data of type T
  output port pOut: P

}
----

This works, but if the only user of `pIn` is
`ExternalSelfMessage`, it is cumbersome.
We need to declare two ports and connect them.
Instead, we can use an internal port, like this:

[source,fpp]
----
@ A data type T
type T

@ A component that sends data to itself on an internal port
active component InternalSelfMessage {

  @ An internal port for sending data of type T
  internal port pInternal(t: T)

}
----

When the implementation of `InternalSelfMessage` invokes
the port `pInternal`, a message goes on its queue.
This corresponds to the behavior of `pOut` in
`ExternalSelfMessage`.
Later, when the framework dispatches the message, it
calls a handler function associated with the port.
This corresponds to the behavior of `pIn` in
`ExternalSelfMessage`.
So an internal port is like two ports (an output port
and an async input port) fused into one.

When writing an internal port, you do not use a named
port definition.
Instead, you provide the formal parameters directly.
Notice that when defining `ExternalSelfMessage` we
defined and used the port `P`, but when defining
`InternalSelfMessage` we did not.
The formal parameters of an internal port work in the same way
as for a <<Defining-Ports_Formal-Parameters,port definition>>,
except that none of the parameters may be a
<<Defining-Ports_Reference-Parameters,reference parameter>>.

When specifying an internal port, you may specify
<<Defining-Components_Port-Instances_Priority,priority>> and
<<Defining-Components_Port-Instances_Queue-Full-Behavior,queue full behavior>>
as for an async input port.
For example, we can add priority and queue full behavior
to `pInternal` as follows:

[source,fpp]
----
@ A data type T
type T

@ A component that sends data to itself on an internal port,
@ with priority and queue full behavior
active component InternalSelfMessage {

  @ An internal port for sending data of type T
  internal port pInternal(t: T) priority 10 drop

}
----

Internal ports generate async input, so they make sense
only for `active` and `queued` components.
As an example, consider the following component
definition:

[source,fpp]
--------
type T

passive component PassiveInternalPort {

  # Internal ports don't make sense for passive components
  internal port pInternal(t: T)

}
--------

What do you think will happen if you run `fpp-check`
on this code?
Try it and see.

=== Commands

When defining an F Prime component, you may specify one or more commands.
When you are operating the FSW, you use the F Prime Ground Data System
or another ground data system to send commands to the FSW.
On receipt of a command _C_, a Command Dispatcher component instance
dispatches _C_ to the component instance where that command is implemented.
The command is handled in a {cpp} command handler that you write
as part of the component implementation.

For complete information about F Prime command dispatch and
handling, see the
https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/latest/docs/user-manual/[F Prime User Manual].
Here we concentrate on how to specify commands in FPP.

==== Basic Commands

The simplest command consists of a kind followed by the keyword
`command` and a name.
The kind is one of the following:

* `async`: The command arrives on a message queue, to
be dispatched on this component's thread (if this component is active)
or on the thread of a port invocation (if this component is queued).

* `sync`: The command invokes a handler defined in this component,
and run on the thread of the caller.

* `guarded`: Similar to sync input, but the handler is
guarded by a mutual exclusion lock.

Notice that the kinds of commands are similar to the kinds of
<<Defining-Components_Port-Instances_Basic-Port-Instances,
input ports>>.
The name is the name of the command.

As an example, here is an active component called `Action`
with two commands: an async command `START` and a sync
command `STOP`.

[source,fpp]
----
@ An active component for performing an action
active component Action {

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Ports
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Command input
  command recv port cmdIn

  @ Command registration
  command reg port cmdRegOut

  @ Command response
  command resp port cmdResponseOut

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Commands
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Start the action
  async command START

  @ Stop the action
  sync command STOP

}
----

Command `START` is declared `async`.
That means that when a `START` command is dispatched
to an instance of this component, it arrives on a queue.
Later, the F Prime framework takes the message off the queue
and calls the corresponding handler on the thread
of the component.

Command `STOP` is declared `sync`.
That means that the command runs immediately on the
thread of the invoking component (for example,
a command dispatcher component).
Because the command runs immediately, its handler
should be very short.
For example, it could set a stop flag and then exit.

Notice that we defined the three
<<Defining-Components_Special-Port-Instances_Command-Ports,
command ports>>
for this component.
All three ports are required for any component that has commands.
As an example, try deleting one or more of the command ports from the
code above and running the result through `fpp-check`.

`async` commands require a message queue, so
they are allowed only for active and queued
components.
As an example, try making the `Action` component passive and
running the result through `fpp-check`.

==== Formal Parameters

When specifying a command, you may specify one or more
formal parameters.
The parameters are bound to arguments when the command
is sent to the spacecraft.
Different uses of the same command can have different
argument values.

The formal parameters of a command are the same
as for a <<Defining-Ports_Formal-Parameters,port definition>>, except
for the following:

. None of the parameters may be a
<<Defining-Ports_Reference-Parameters,reference parameter>>.

. Each parameter must have a *displayable type*, i.e., a
type that the F Prime ground data system knows how to display.
For example, the type may not be an 
<<Defining-Types_Abstract-Type-Definitions,abstract type>>.
Nor may it be an array or struct type that has an abstract type
as a member type.

As an example, here is a `Switch` component that has
two states, `ON` and `OFF`.
The component has a `SET_STATE` command for
setting the state.
The command has a single argument `state`
that specifies the new state.

[source,fpp]
----
@ The state enumeration
enum State {
  OFF @< The off state
  ON @< The on state
}

@ A switch with on and off state
active component Switch {

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Ports
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Command input
  command recv port cmdIn

  @ Command registration
  command reg port cmdRegOut

  @ Command response
  command resp port cmdResponseOut

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Commands
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Set the state
  async command SET_STATE(
    $state: State @< The new state
  )

}
----

In this example, the enum type `State` is a displayable type because
its definition is known to FPP.
Try replacing the enum definition with the
abstract type definition `type S` and see what happens when
you run the model through `fpp-check`.
Remember to <<Defining-Components_Special-Port-Instances_Command-Ports,provide 
stubs for the special command ports>> that are required by
`fpp-check`.

==== Opcodes

Every command in an F Prime FSW application has an *opcode*.
The opcode is a number that uniquely identifies the command.
The F Prime framework uses the opcode when dispatching commands
because it is a more compact identifier than the name.
The name is mainly for human interaction on the ground.

The opcodes associated with each component _C_
are relative to the component.
Typically the opcodes start at zero: that is, the
opcodes are 0, 1, 2, etc.
When constructing an instance _I_ of component _C_,
the framework adds a base opcode for _I_ to each relative opcode
associated with _C_ to form
the global opcodes associated with _I_.
That way different instances of _C_ can have different opcodes
for the same commands defined in _C_.
We will have more to say about base and relative opcodes
when we describe component instances and topologies.

If you specify a command _c_ with no explicit opcode, as in the examples
shown in the previous sections, then FPP assigns a default opcode
to _c_.
The default opcode for the first command in a component is zero.
Otherwise the default opcode for any command is one more than
the opcode of the previous command.

It is usually convenient to rely on the default opcodes.
However, you may wish to specify one or more opcodes explicitly.
To do this, you write the keyword `opcode` followed
by a numeric expression after the command name and after the
formal parameters, if any.
Here is an example:

[source,fpp]
----
@ Component for illustrating command opcodes
active component CommandOpcodes {

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Ports
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Command input
  command recv port cmdIn

  @ Command registration
  command reg port cmdRegOut

  @ Command response
  command resp port cmdResponseOut

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Commands
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ This command has default opcode 0x0
  async command COMMAND_1

  @ This command has explicit opcode 0x10
  async command COMMAND_2(a: F32, b: U32) opcode 0x10

  @ This command has default opcode 0x11
  sync command COMMAND_3

}
----

Within a component, the command opcodes must be unique.
For example, this component is incorrect because
the opcode zero appears twice:

[source,fpp]
--------
@ Component for illustrating a duplicate opcode
active component DuplicateOpcode {

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Ports
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Command input
  command recv port cmdIn

  @ Command registration
  command reg port cmdRegOut

  @ Command response
  command resp port cmdResponseOut

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Commands
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ This command has opcode 0x0
  async command COMMAND_1

  @ Oops! This command also has opcode 0x0
  async command COMMAND_2 opcode 0x0

}
--------

==== Priority and Queue Full Behavior

When specifying an async command, you may specify
<<Defining-Components_Port-Instances_Priority,priority>> and
<<Defining-Components_Port-Instances_Queue-Full-Behavior,queue full behavior>>
as for an async input port.
You put the priority and queue full information after the command name
and after the formal parameters and opcode, if any.
Here is an example:

[source,fpp]
----
@ A component for illustrating priority and queue full behavior for async
@ commands
active component PriorityQueueFull {

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Ports
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Command input
  command recv port cmdIn

  @ Command registration
  command reg port cmdRegOut

  @ Command response
  command resp port cmdResponseOut

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Commands
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Command with priority
  async command COMMAND_1 priority 10

  @ Command with formal parameters and priority
  async command COMMAND_2(a: U32, b: F32) priority 20

  @ Command with formal parameters, opcode, priority, and queue full behavior
  async command COMMAND_3(a: string) opcode 0x10 priority 30 drop

}
----

Priority and queue full behavior are allowed only for
`async` commands.
Try changing one of the commands in the previous example
to `sync` and see what `fpp-check` has to say about it.

=== Events

When defining an F Prime component, you may specify one or more events.
The F Prime framework converts each event into a {cpp}
function that you can call from the component implementation.
Calling the function emits a serialized event report that
you can store in an on-board file system or send to the ground.

For complete information about F Prime event
handling, see the
https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/latest/docs/user-manual/[F Prime User Manual].
Here we concentrate on how to specify events in FPP.

==== Basic Events

The simplest event consists of the keyword `event`, a name, a severity,
and a format string.
The name is the name of the event.
A severity is the keyword `severity` and one of the following:

* `activity` `high`: Spacecraft activity of greater importance.

* `activity` `low`: Spacecraft activity of lesser importance.

* `command`: An event related to commanding.
Primarily used by the command dispatcher.

* `diagnostic`: An event relating to system diagnosis
and debugging.

* `fatal`: An event that causes the system to abort.

* `warning` `high`: A warning of greater importance.

* `warning` `low`: A warning of lesser importance.

A format is the keyword `format` and a literal string for
use in a formatted real-time display or event log.

As an example, here is an active component called `BasicEvents`
with a few basic events.

[source,fpp]
----
@ A component for illustrating basic events
passive component BasicEvents {

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Ports
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Event port
  event port eventOut

  @ Text event port
  text event port textEventOut

  @ Time get port
  time get port timeGetOut

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Events
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Activity low event
  event Event1 severity activity low format "Event 1 occurred"

  @ Warning low event
  event Event2 severity warning low format "Event 2 occurred"

  @ Warning high event
  event Event3 severity warning high format "Event 3 occurred"

}
----

Notice that we defined the two
<<Defining-Components_Special-Port-Instances_Event-Ports,
event ports>>
and a
<<Defining-Components_Special-Port-Instances_Time-Get-Ports,
time get port>>
for this component.
All three ports are required for any component that has events.
As an example, try deleting one or more of these ports from the
code above and running the result through `fpp-check`.

==== Formal Parameters

When specifying an event, you may specify one or more
formal parameters.
The parameters are bound to arguments when the component
instance emits the event.
The argument values appear in the formatted text
that describes the event.

You specify the formal parameters of an event in the same
way as for a <<Defining-Components_Commands_Formal-Parameters,command 
specifier>>.
For each formal parameter, there must be a corresponding
replacement field in the format string.
The replacement fields for event format strings are the same as for
format strings in
<<Defining-Types_Array-Type-Definitions_Format-Strings,
type definitions>>.
The replacement fields in the format string match the event
parameters, one for one and in the same order.

As an example, here is a component with two events,
each of which has formal parameters.
Notice how the replacement fields in the event format
strings correspond to the formal parameters.

[source,fpp]
----
@ An enumeration of cases
enum Case { A, B, C }

@ An array of 3 F64 values
array F64x3 = [3] F64

@ A component for illustrating event formal parameters
passive component EventParameters {

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Ports
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Event port
  event port eventOut

  @ Text event port
  text event port textEventOut

  @ Time get port
  time get port timeGetOut

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Events
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Event 1
  @ Sample output: "Event 1 occurred with argument 42"
  event Event1(
    arg1: U32 @< Argument 1
  ) \
    severity activity high \
    format "Event 1 occurred with argument {}"

  @ Event 2
  @ Sample output: "Saw value [ 0.001, 0.002, 0.003 ] for case A"
  event Event2(
    case: Case @< The case
    value: F64x3 @< The value
  ) \
    severity warning low \
    format "Saw value {} for case {}"

}
----

==== Identifiers

Every event in an F Prime FSW application has a unique
numeric identifier.
As for
<<Defining-Components_Commands_Opcodes,command opcodes>>,
the event identifiers for a component are specified
relative to the component, usually starting from
zero and counting up by one.
If you omit the identifier, then
FPP assigns a default identifier: zero for the first
event in the component; otherwise one more than the
identifier of the previous event.

If you wish, you may explicitly specify one or more event
identifiers.
To do this, you write the keyword `id` followed
by a numeric expression immediately before the keyword `format`.
Here is an example:

[source,fpp]
----
@ Component for illustrating event identifiers
passive component EventIdentifiers {

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Ports
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Event port
  event port eventOut

  @ Text event port
  text event port textEventOut

  @ Time get port
  time get port timeGetOut

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Events
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Event 1
  @ Its identifier is 0x00
  event Event1 severity activity low \
    id 0x10 \
    format "Event 1 occurred"

  @ Event 2
  @ Its identifier is 0x10
  event Event2(
    count: U32 @< The count
  ) \
    severity activity high \
    id 0x11 \
    format "The count is {}"

  @ Event 3
  @ Its identifier is 0x11
  event Event3 severity activity high \
    format "Event 3 occurred"

}
----

Within a component, the event identifiers must be unique.

==== Throttling

Sometimes it is necessary to throttle events, to ensure that
they do not flood the system.
For example, suppose that the FSW requests some resource _R_
at a rate _r_ of several times per second.
Suppose further that if _R_ is unavailable, then the FSW
emits a warning event.
In this case, we typically do not want the FSW to emit an unbounded number
of warnings at rate _r_; instead, we want it to emit a single warning
or a few warnings.

To achieve this behavior, you can write the keyword `throttle` and a
numeric expression after the format string.
The expression must evaluate to a constant value _n_.
After an instance of the component has emitted the event _n_ times, it will
stop emitting the event.
Here is an example:

[source,fpp]
----
@ Component for illustrating event throttling
passive component EventThrottling {

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Ports
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Event port
  event port eventOut

  @ Text event port
  text event port textEventOut

  @ Time get port
  time get port timeGetOut

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Events
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Event 1
  event Event1 severity warning high \
    format "Event 1 occurred" \
    throttle 10

}
----

In this example, event `E` will be throttled after the component
instance has emitted it ten times.

Once an event is throttled, the component instance will no longer
emit the event until the throttling is canceled.
Typically, the canceling happens via a FSW command.
For details, see the
https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/latest/docs/user-manual/[F Prime User Manual].

=== Telemetry

When defining an F Prime component, you may specify one or more
*telemetry channels*.
A telemetry channel consists of a data type and an identifier.
The F Prime framework converts each telemetry into a {cpp}
function that you can call from the component implementation.
Calling the function emits a value on the channel.
Each emitted value is called a
*telemetry point*.
You can store the telemetry points in an on-board file system
or send them the ground.

For complete information about F Prime telemetry
handling, see the
https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/latest/docs/user-manual/[F Prime User Manual].
Here we concentrate on how to specify telemetry channels in FPP.

==== Basic Telemetry

The simplest telemetry channel consists of the keyword `telemetry`,
a name, and a data type.
The name is the name of the channel.
The data type is the type of data carried on the channel.
The data type must be a 
<<Defining-Components_Commands_Formal-Parameters,displayable type>>.

As an example, here is an active component called `BasicTelemetry`
with a few basic events.

[source,fpp]
----
@ An array of 3 F64 values
array F64x3 = [3] F64

@ A component for illustrating basic telemetry channels
passive component BasicTelemetry {

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Ports
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Telemetry port
  telemetry port tlmOut

  @ Time get port
  time get port timeGetOut

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Telemetry
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Telemetry channel 1
  telemetry Channel1: U32

  @ Telemetry channel 2
  telemetry Channel2: F64

  @ Telemetry channel 3
  telemetry Channel3: F64x3

}
----

Notice that we defined a
<<Defining-Components_Special-Port-Instances_Telemetry-Ports,
telemetry port>>
and a
<<Defining-Components_Special-Port-Instances_Time-Get-Ports,
time get port>>
for this component.
Both ports are required for any component that has telemetry.

==== Identifiers

Every telemetry channel in an F Prime FSW application has a unique
numeric identifier.
As for
<<Defining-Components_Commands_Opcodes,command opcodes>>
and
<<Defining-Components_Events_Identifiers,event identifiers>>,
the telemetry channel identifiers for a component are specified
relative to the component, usually starting from
zero and counting up by one.
If you omit the identifier, then
FPP assigns a default identifier: zero for the first
event in the component; otherwise one more than the
identifier of the previous channel.

If you wish, you may explicitly specify one or more
telemetry channel identifiers.
To do this, you write the keyword `id` followed
by a numeric expression immediately after the data type.
Here is an example:

[source,fpp]
----
@ An array of 3 F64 values
array F64x3 = [3] F64

@ Component for illustrating telemetry channel identifiers
passive component TlmIdentifiers {

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Ports
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Telemetry port
  telemetry port tlmOut

  @ Time get port
  time get port timeGetOut

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Telemetry
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Telemetry channel 1
  @ Its implied identifier is 0x00
  telemetry Channel1: U32

  @ Telemetry channel 2
  @ Its identifier is 0x10
  telemetry Channel2: F64 id 0x10

  @ Telemetry channel 3
  @ Its implied identifier is 0x11
  telemetry Channel3: F64x3

}
----

Within a component, the telemetry channel identifiers must be unique.

==== Update Frequency

You can specify how often the telemetry is emitted on a channel _C_.
There are two possibilities:

* `always`: Emit a telemetry point on _C_
whenever the component implementation calls the
auto-generated function _F_ that emits telemetry on _C_.

* `on` `change`: Emit a telemetry point whenever
(1) the implementation calls _F_ and (2) either (a)
_F_ has not been called before or
(b) the last time that _F_ was called, the argument
to _F_ had a different value.

Emitting telemetry on change can reduce unnecessary
activity in the system.
For example, suppose a telemetry channel _C_ counts
the number of times that some event _E_ occurs
in a periodic task,
and suppose that _E_ does not occur on every cycle.
If you declare channel _C_ `on` `change`, then your implementation
can call the telemetry emit function for _C_ on every
cycle, and telemetry will be emitted only when
_E_ occurs.

To specify an update frequency, you write the keyword `update`
and one of the frequency selectors shown above.
The update specifier goes after
the type name and after the channel identifier, if any.
If you don't specify an update frequency, then the default
value is `always`.
Here is an example:

[source,fpp]
----
@ An array of 3 F64 values
array F64x3 = [3] F64

@ Component for illustrating telemetry channel update specifiers
passive component TlmUpdate {

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Ports
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Telemetry port
  telemetry port tlmOut

  @ Time get port
  time get port timeGetOut

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Telemetry
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Telemetry channel 1
  @ Always emitted
  telemetry Channel1: U32

  @ Telemetry channel 2
  @ Emitted on change
  telemetry Channel2: F64 id 0x10 update on change

  @ Telemetry channel 3
  @ Always emitted
  telemetry Channel3: F64x3 update always

}
----

==== Format Strings

You may specify how a telemetry channel is formatted in the
ground display.
To do this, you write the keyword `format` and a format string
with one
<<Defining-Types_Array-Type-Definitions_Format-Strings,
replacement field>>.
The replacement field must match the type of the telemetry
channel.
The format specifier comes after the type name, after the
channel identifier, and after the update specifier.

Here is an example:

[source,fpp]
----
@ Component for illustrating telemetry channel format specifiers
passive component TlmFormat {

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Ports
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Telemetry port
  telemetry port tlmOut

  @ Time get port
  time get port timeGetOut

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Telemetry
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Telemetry channel 1
  telemetry Channel1: U32 format "{x}"

  @ Telemetry channel 2
  telemetry Channel2: F64 id 0x10 \
    update on change \
    format "{.3f}"

  @ Telemetry channel 3
  telemetry Channel3: F64\
    update always \
    format "{e}"

}
----

==== Limits

You may specify *limits*, or bounds, on the expected values
carried on a telemetry channel.
There are two kinds of limits: `low` (meaning that the
values on the channel should stay above the limit) and `high`
(meaning that the values should stay below the limit).
Within each kind, there are three levels of severity:

* `yellow`: Crossing the limit is of low concern.

* `orange`: Crossing the limit is of medium concern.

* `red`: Crossing the limit is of high concern.

The F Prime ground data system displays an appropriate warning
when a telemetry point crosses a limit.

The limit specifiers come after the type name, identifier,
update specifier, and format string.
You specify the low limits (if any) first, and then the high limits.
For the low limits, you write the keyword `low` followed by a
list of limits in curly braces `{ ... }`.
For the high limits, you do the same  thing but use the keyword
`high`.
Each limit is a severity keyword followed by a numeric expression.
Here are some examples:


[source,fpp]
----
@ Component for illustrating telemetry channel limits
passive component TlmLimits {

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Ports
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Telemetry port
  telemetry port tlmOut

  @ Time get port
  time get port timeGetOut

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Telemetry
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Telemetry channel 1
  telemetry Channel1: U32 \
    low { red 0, orange 1, yellow 2 }

  @ Telemetry channel 2
  telemetry Channel2: F64 id 0x10 \
    update on change \
    format "{.3f}" \
    low { red -3, orange -2, yellow -1 } \
    high { red 3, orange 2, yellow 1 }

  @ Telemetry channel 3
  telemetry Channel3: F64 \
    update always \
    format "{e}" \
    high { red 3, orange 2, yellow 1 }

}
----

Each limit must be a numeric value.
The type of the telemetry channel must be (1) a numeric
type; or (2) an array or struct type each of whose members
has a numeric type; or (3) an array or struct type
each of whose members satisfies condition (1) or
condition (2).

=== Parameters

When defining an F Prime component, you may specify one or more
*parameters*.
A parameter is a typed constant value that you can update
by command.
For example, it could be a configuration constant
for a hardware device or a software algorithm.

F Prime has special support for parameters, including a parameter
database component for storing parameters in a non-volatile
manner (e.g., on a file system).
For complete information about F Prime parameters, see the
https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/latest/docs/user-manual/[F Prime User Manual].
Here we concentrate on how to specify parameters in FPP.

==== Basic Parameters

The simplest parameter consists of the keyword `param`,
a name, and a data type.
The name is the name of the parameter.
The data type is the type of data stored in the parameter.
The data type must be a 
<<Defining-Components_Commands_Formal-Parameters,displayable type>>.

As an example, here is an active component called `BasicParams`
with a few basic parameters.

[source,fpp]
----
@ An array of 3 F64 values
array F64x3 = [3] F64

@ A component for illustrating basic parameters
passive component BasicParams {

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Ports
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Command receive port
  command recv port cmdIn

  @ Command registration port
  command reg port cmdRegOut

  @ Command response port
  command resp port cmdResponseOut

  @ Parameter get port
  param get port prmGetOut

  @ Parameter set port
  param set port prmSetOut

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Parameters
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Parameter 1
  param Param1: U32

  @ Parameter 2
  param Param2: F64

  @ Parameter 3
  param Param3: F64x3

}
----

Notice that we defined the two
<<Defining-Components_Special-Port-Instances_Parameter-Ports,
parameter ports>>
for this component.
Both ports are required for any component that has parameters.

Notice also that we defined the
<<Defining-Components_Special-Port-Instances_Command-Ports,
command ports>>
for this component.
When you add one or more parameters to a component,
F Prime automatically generates commands for (1)
setting the local parameter in the component and (2) saving
the local parameter to a system-wide parameter database.
Therefore, any component that has parameters must have
the command ports.
Try deleting one or more of the command ports from the example
above and see what `fpp-check` does.

==== Default Values

You can specify a default value for any parameter.
This is the value that F Prime will use if no value is
available in the parameter database.
If you don't specify a default value, and no value is
available in the database, then attempting to get
the parameter produces an invalid value.
What happens then is up to the FSW implementation.
By providing default values for your parameters,
you can avoid handling this case.

Here is the example from the previous section, updated
to include default values for the parameters:

[source,fpp]
----
@ An array of 3 F64 values
array F64x3 = [3] F64

@ A component for illustrating default parameter values
passive component ParamDefaults {

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Ports
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Command receive port
  command recv port cmdIn

  @ Command registration port
  command reg port cmdRegOut

  @ Command response port
  command resp port cmdResponseOut

  @ Parameter get port
  param get port prmGetOut

  @ Parameter set port
  param set port prmSetOut

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Parameters
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Parameter 1
  param Param1: U32 default 1

  @ Parameter 2
  param Param2: F64 default 2.0

  @ Parameter 3
  param Param3: F64x3 default [ 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 ]

}
----

==== Identifiers

Every parameter in an F Prime FSW application has a unique
numeric identifier.
As for
<<Defining-Components_Commands_Opcodes,command opcodes>>,
<<Defining-Components_Events_Identifiers,event identifiers>>,
and
<<Defining-Components_Telemetry_Identifiers,
telemetry channel identifiers>>,
the parameter identifiers for a component are specified
relative to the component, usually starting from
zero and counting up by one.
If you omit the identifier, then
FPP assigns a default identifier: zero for the first
event in the component; otherwise one more than the
identifier of the previous parameter.

If you wish, you may explicitly specify one or more
parameter identifiers.
To do this, you write the keyword `id` followed
by a numeric expression after the data type
and after the default value, if any.
Here is an example:

[source,fpp]
----
@ An array of 3 F64 values
array F64x3 = [3] F64

@ A component for illustrating default parameter identifiers
passive component ParamIdentifiers {

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Ports
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Command receive port
  command recv port cmdIn

  @ Command registration port
  command reg port cmdRegOut

  @ Command response port
  command resp port cmdResponseOut

  @ Parameter get port
  param get port prmGetOut

  @ Parameter set port
  param set port prmSetOut

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Parameters
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Parameter 1
  @ Its implied identifier is 0x00
  param Param1: U32 default 1

  @ Parameter 2
  @ Its identifier is 0x10
  param Param2: F64 default 2.0 id 0x10

  @ Parameter 3
  @ Its implied identifier is 0x11
  param Param3: F64x3 default [ 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 ]

}
----

Within a component, the parameter identifiers must be unique.

==== Set and Save Opcodes

Each parameter that you specify has two implied commands: one
for setting the value bound to the parameter locally in the
component, and one for saving the current local value
to the system-wide parameter database.
The opcodes for these implied commands are called the *set and
save opcodes* for the parameter.

By default, FPP generates set and save opcodes for a
parameter _P_ according to the following rules:

* If no command or parameter appears before _P_ in the
component, then the set opcode is 0, and the save opcode is 1.

* Otherwise, let _o_ be the previous opcode defined
in the component
(either a command opcode or a parameter save opcode).
Then the set opcode is _o_ + 1, and the save opcode is
_o_ + 2.

If you wish, you may specify either or both of the set and
save opcodes explicitly.
To specify the set opcode, you write the keywords `set` `opcode`
and a numeric expression.
To specify the save opcode, you write the keywords `save` `opcode`
and a numeric expression.
The set and save opcodes come after the type name, default
parameter value, and parameter identifier.
If both are present, the set opcode comes first.

When you specify an explicit set or save opcode _o_, the
default value for the next opcode is _o_ + 1.
Here is an example:

[source,fpp]
----
@ An array of 3 F64 values
array F64x3 = [3] F64

@ A component for illustrating parameter set and save opcodes
passive component ParamOpcodes {

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Ports
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Command receive port
  command recv port cmdIn

  @ Command registration port
  command reg port cmdRegOut

  @ Command response port
  command resp port cmdResponseOut

  @ Parameter get port
  param get port prmGetOut

  @ Parameter set port
  param set port prmSetOut

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Parameters
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Parameter 1
  @ Its implied set opcode is 0x00
  @ Its implied save opcode is 0x01
  param Param1: U32 default 1

  @ Parameter 2
  @ Its set opcode is 0x10
  @ Its save opcode is 0x11
  param Param2: F64 \
    default 2.0 \
    id 0x10 \
    set opcode 0x10 \
    save opcode 0x11

  @ Parameter 3
  @ Its set opcode is 0x12
  @ Its save opcode is 0x20
  param Param3: F64x3 \
    default [ 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 ] \
    save opcode 0x20

}

=== Data Products

When defining an F Prime component, you may specify the *data products*
produced by that component.
A data product is a collection of related data that is stored onboard
and transmitted to the ground.
F Prime has special support for data products, including components
for (1) managing buffers that can store data products in memory;
(2) writing data products to the file system; and (3)
cataloging stored data products for downlink in priority order.
For more information about these F Prime features, see the
https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/latest/docs/user-manual/design/data-products/[F 
Prime design documentation].

==== Basic Data Products

In F Prime, a data product is represented as a *container*.
One container holds one data product, and each data product
is typically stored in its own file.
A container consists of a header, which provides information about
the container (e.g., the size of the data payload), and binary data
representing a list of serialized *records*.
A record is a unit of data.
For a complete specification of the container format, see the 
https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/latest/Fw/Dp/docs/sdd/[F Prime design 
documentation].

In an F Prime component, you can specify one or more containers
and one or more records.
The simplest container specification consists of the keywords `product` `container`
and a name.
The name is the name of the container.
The simplest record specification consists of the keywords `product` `record`,
a name, and a data type.
The name is the name of the record.
The data type is the type of the data that the record holds.

As an example, here is a component called `BasicDataProducts` that specifies
two records and two containers.

[source,fpp]
----
@ A struct type defining some data
struct Data { a: U32, b: F32 }

@ A component for illustrating basic data products
passive component BasicDataProducts {

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Ports 
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Product get port
  product get port productGetOut

  @ Product send port
  product send port productSendOut

  @ Time get port
  time get port timeGetOut

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Records 
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Record 1
  product record Record1: I32

  @ Record 2
  product record Record2: Data
  
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Containers 
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Container 1
  product container Container1

  @ Container 2
  product container Container2

}
----

The FPP back end uses this specification to generate code for requesting
buffers to hold containers and for serializing records into containers.
See the
https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/latest/docs/user-manual/design/data-products/[F
Prime design documentation] for the details.

Note the following:

* Records are not specific to containers.
For example, with the specification shown above, you can serialize instances of 
`Record1` and `Record2` into either or both of `Container1` and `Container2`.

* Like telemetry channels, F Prime containers are component-centric.
A component can request containers that it defines, and it can fill those
containers with records that it defines.
It cannot use records or containers defined by another component.

* If a component has container specifier, then it must have at least one record 
specifier, and vice versa.

==== Identifiers

Every record in an F Prime FSW application has a unique
numeric identifier.
As for
<<Defining-Components_Commands_Opcodes,command opcodes>>,
<<Defining-Components_Events_Identifiers,event identifiers>>,
<<Defining-Components_Telemetry_Identifiers,
telemetry channel identifiers>>, and
<<Defining-Components_Parameters,parameters>>,
the record identifiers for a component are specified
relative to the component, usually starting from
zero and counting up by one.
If you omit the identifier, then
FPP assigns a default identifier: zero for the first
event in the component; otherwise one more than the
identifier of the previous parameter.
The same observations apply to containers and container
identifiers.

If you wish, you may explicitly specify one or more
container or record identifiers.
To do this, you write the keyword `id` followed
by a numeric expression at the end of the container
or record specifier.
Here is an example:

[source,fpp]
----
@ A struct type defining some data
struct Data { a: U32, b: F32 }

@ A component for illustrating data product identifiers
passive component DataProductIdentifiers {

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Ports 
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Product get port
  product get port productGetOut

  @ Product send port
  product send port productSendOut

  @ Time get port
  time get port timeGetOut

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Records 
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Record 1
  @ Its implied identifier is 0x00
  product record Record1: I32

  @ Record 2
  @ Its identifier is 0x10
  product record Record2: Data id 0x10
  
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Containers 
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Container 1
  @ Its identifier is 0x10
  product container Container1 id 0x10

  @ Container 2
  @ Its implied identifier is 0x11
  product container Container2

}
----

Within a component, the record identifiers must be unique,
and the container identifiers must be unique.

==== Array Records

In the basic form of a record described above, each record that
does not have 
<<Defining-Types_Array-Type-Definitions_Type-Names,string type>>
has a fixed, statically-specified size.
The record may contain an array (e.g., an
<<Defining-Types_Array-Type-Definitions,array type>>
or a struct type with a
<<Defining-Types_Struct-Type-Definitions_Member-Arrays,member array>>),
but the size of the array must be specified in the model.
To specify a record that is a dynamically-sized array, you put
the keyword `array` after the type specifier for the record.
For example:

[source,fpp]
----
@ A struct type defining some data
struct Data { a: U32, b: F32 }

@ A component for illustrating array records
passive component ArrayRecords {

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Ports 
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Product get port
  product get port productGetOut

  @ Product send port
  product send port productSendOut

  @ Time get port
  time get port timeGetOut

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Records 
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ A data record
  @ It holds one element of type Data
  product record DataRecord: Data

  @ A data array record
  @ It holds an array of elements of type Data
  product record DataArrayRecord: Data array

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Containers 
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ A container
  product container Container

}
----

In this example, a record with name `DataArrayRecord` holds
an array of elements of type `Data`.
The number of elements is unspecified in the model;
it is provided when the record is serialized into a container.

=== State Machine Instances

A *state machine instance* is a component member that instantiates
an FPP <<Defining-State-Machines,state machine>>.
The state machine instance becomes part of the component implementation.

For example, here is a simple async component that has
one state machine instance and one async input port
for driving the state machine:

[source,fpp]
----
@ An external state machine
state machine M

@ A component with a state machine
active component StateMachine {

  @ A port for driving the state machine
  async input port schedIn: Svc.Sched

  @ An instance of state machine M
  state machine instance m: M

}
----

When a state machine instance _m_ is part of a component _C_,
each instance _c_ of _C_ sends _m_ *signals* to process as it runs.
Signals occur in response to commands or port
invocations received by _c_, and they tell _m_ when to change state.
_c_ puts the signals on its queue, and _m_ dispatches them.
Therefore, if a component _C_ has a state machine instance member _m_,
then its instances _c_ must have queues, i.e., _C_ must be active or queued.

As with <<Defining-Components_Internal-Ports,internal ports>>,
you may specify priority and queue full behavior associated
with the signals dispatched by a state machine instance.
For example, we can revise the example above as follows:

[source,fpp]
----
@ An external state machine
state machine M

@ A component with a state machine
active component StateMachine {

  @ A port for driving the state machine
  async input port schedIn: Svc.Sched

  @ An instance of state machine M
  state machine instance m: M priority 10 drop

}
----

As discussed
<<Defining-State-Machines_Writing-a-State-Machine-Definition,above>>, state
machine definitions may be internal (specified in FPP) or external (specified
by an external tool).  For more details about the {cpp} code generation for
instances of internal state machines, see the
https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/latest/docs/user-manual/design/state-machines/[F 
Prime design documentation].

=== Constants, Types, Enums, and State Machines

You can write a <<Defining-Constants,constant definition>>,
<<Defining-Types,type definition>>, 
<<Defining-Enums,enum definition>>, 
or
<<Defining-State-Machines,state machine definition>>
as a component member.
When you do this, the component qualifies
the name of the constant or type, similarly to the way that a
<<Defining-Modules,module>> qualifies the names of the
definitions it contains.
For example, if you define a type `T` inside a component
`C`, then

* Inside the definition of `C`, you can refer to the
type as `T`.

* Outside the definition of `C`, you must refer to the
type as `C.T`.

As an example, here is the `SerialSplitter` component
from the section on
<<Defining-Components_Port-Instances_Serial-Port-Instances,
serial port instances>>, where we have moved the
definition of the constant `splitFactor`
into the definition of the component.

[source,fpp]
----
@ Component for splitting a serial data stream
passive component SerialSplitter {

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Constants
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Split factor
  constant splitFactor = 10

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Ports
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Input
  sync input port serialIn: serial

  @ Output
  output port serialOut: [splitFactor] serial

}
----

As another example, here is the `Switch` component from the section on
<<Defining-Components_Commands_Formal-Parameters,
command formal parameters>>, where we have moved the definition of
the enum `State` into the component:

[source,fpp]
----
@ A switch with on and off state
active component Switch {

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Types
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ The state enumeration
  enum State {
    OFF @< The off state
    ON @< The on state
  }

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Ports
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Command input
  command recv port cmdIn

  @ Command registration
  command reg port cmdRegOut

  @ Command response
  command resp port cmdResponseOut

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Commands
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  @ Set the state
  async command SET_STATE(
    $state: State @< The new state
  )

}
----

In general, it is a good idea to state a definition inside a component
when the definition logically belongs to the component.
The name scoping mechanism emphasizes the hierarchical relationship
and prevents name clashes.

In most cases, a qualified name such as `Switch.State`
in FPP becomes a qualified name such as `Switch::State` when translating
to {cpp}.
However, the F Prime XML format does not support the definition
of constants and types as members of {cpp} components.
Therefore, when translating the previous example to {cpp},
the following occurs:

. The component `Switch` becomes an auto-generated {cpp} class
`SwitchComponentBase`.

. The type `State` becomes a {cpp} class `Switch_State`.

Similarly, the FPP constant `SerialSplitter.splitFactor`
becomes a {cpp} constant `SerialSplitter_SplitFactor`.
We will have more to say about this issue in the sections on
<<Analyzing-and-Translating-Models_Generating-XML,
generating XML>>
and
<<Analyzing-and-Translating-Models_Generating-C-Plus-Plus,
generating {cpp}>>.

=== Include Specifiers

Component definitions can become long, especially when there
are many commands, events, telemetry channels, and parameters.
In this case it is useful to break up the component
definition into several files.

For example, suppose you are defining a component with
many commands, and you wish to place the commands in a
separate file `Commands.fppi`.
The suffix `.fppi` is conventional for included FPP files.
Inside the component definition, you can write the
following component member:

[source,fpp]
--------
include "Commands.fppi"
--------

This construct is called an *include specifier*.
During analysis and translation, the include specifier
is replaced with the commands specified
in `Commands.fppi`, just as if you had written them
at the point where you wrote the include specifier.
This replacement is called expanding or resolving the
include specifier.
You can use the same technique for events, telemetry,
parameters, or any other component members.

The text enclosed in quotation marks after the keyword
`include` is a path name relative to the directory of the
file in which the include specifier appears.
The file must exist and must contain component members
that can validly appear at the point where the include
specifier appears.
For example, if `Commands.fppi` contains invalid syntax
or syntax that may not appear inside a component,
or if the file `Commands.fppi` does not exist, then
the specifier `include "Commands.fppi"` is not valid.

Include specifiers are perhaps most useful when defining
components, but they can also appear at the top level of a
model, inside a module definition, or inside a
topology definition.
We discuss include specifiers further in the section on
<<Specifying-Models-as-Files_Include-Specifiers,
specifying models as files>>.

=== Matched Ports

Some F Prime components employ the following pattern:

. The component has a pair of port arrays, say `p1` and `p2`.
The two arrays have the same number of ports.

. For every connection between `p1` and another component
instance, there must be a matching connection between that
component instance and `p2`.

. The matched pairs in item 2 must be connected to the
same port numbers at `p1` and `p2`.

In this case we call `p1` and `p2` a pair of
*matched ports*.
For example:

* The standard Command Dispatcher component has matched ports
`compCmdReg` for receiving command registration and
`compCmdSend` for sending commands.

* The standard Health component has matched ports
`PingSend` for sending health ping messages and
`PingReturn` for receiving responses to the ping messages.

FPP provides special support for matched ports.
Inside a component definition, you can write
`match p1 with p2`, where `p1` and `p2` are the names of
<<Defining-Components_Port-Instances,port instances>>
defined in the component.
When you do this, the following occurs:

.  The FPP translator checks that `p1` and `p2` have
the same number of ports.
If not, an error occurs.

.  When
<<Defining-Topologies_Port-Numbering_Matched-Numbering,
automatically numbering a topology>>, the
translator ensures that the port numbers match in the manner
described above.

For example, here is a simplified version of the Health
component:

[source,fpp]
----
@ Number of health ping ports
constant numPingPorts = 10

queued component Health {

  @ Ping output port
  output port pingOut: [numPingPorts] Svc.Ping

  @ Ping input port
  async input port pingIn: [numPingPorts] Svc.Ping

  @ Corresponding port numbers of pingOut and pingIn must match
  match pingOut with pingIn

}
----

This component defines a pair of matched ports
`pingOut` and `pingIn`.
